## Notes

### Small notes

- Shyness and introversion are two different things. P12
- > A popular 1926 sex guide observed, “homosexuals are invariably timid, shy, retiring.” P25
- At 37signals they have “No-Talk Thursdays” where employees aren’t allowed to talk to one another so they can focus on work. P86
- “Overarousal interferes with attention and short-term memory”. Introverts are aroused more easily than extroverts (and we’re talking about brain, not sexual arousal here). That’s why they might remember less of a conversation in a busy, noisy environment than an extrovert. P126
- “When someone offers you a beer, they’re really saying ‘hi, have a glass of extroversion’” — Brian Little. P143
- > “A 2010 University of Michigan study shows that college students today are 40 percent less empathetic than they were thirty years ago, with much of the drop having occurred since 2000. (The study's authors speculate that the decline in empathy is related to the prevalence of social media, reality TV, and "hyper-competitiveness.")” P141
- Blushing is largely uncontrollable and difficult to fake. That makes it useful in judging what people are feeling. P144
- Extroverts seem to get a bigger hit of dopamine from dopamine-rewarding activities.

### Introduction

#### [[Rosa Parks]]

Despite being known for a defiant act that required bravery, Rosa Parks was known to be timid and shy. She was described as soft-spoken, sweet and small in stature.

I didn’t realise that the Montgomery Improvement Association arranged a boycott of the city buses after the Parks incident. It lasted 381 days. P1-2

Parks had had a run-in with the bus driver of the bus she refused to move out of the seat of 12 years prior. He was a known bigot and she strongly disliked him:

> Not many people know that twelve years before her showdown with the Montgomery bus driver, she’d had another encounter with the same man, possibly on the very same bus. It was a November afternoon in 1943, and Parks had entered through the front door of the bus because the back was too crowded. The driver, a well-known bigot named James Blake, told her to use the rear and started to push her off the bus. Parks asked him not to touch her. She would leave on her own, she said quietly. “Get off my bus,” Blake sputtered in response.
> 
> Parks complied, but not before deliberately dropping her purse on her way out and sitting on a “white” seat as she picked it up. “Intuitively, she had engaged in an act of passive resistance, a precept named by Leo Tolstoy and embraced by Mahatma Gandhi,” writes the historian Douglas Brinkley in a wonderful biography of Parks. It was more than a decade before King popularized the idea of nonviolence and long before Parks’s own training in civil disobedience, but, Brinkley writes, “such principles were a perfect match for her own personality.”
>
> Parks was so disgusted by Blake that she refused to ride his bus for the next twelve years. On the day she finally did, the day that turned her into the “Mother of the Civil Rights Movement,” she got back on that bus, according to Brinkley, only out of sheer absentmindedness.

### The Rise of the “Mighty Likeable Fellow”

#### Dale Carnegie

Dale Carnegie changed his last name to that from “Carnagey” to evoke Andrew Carnegie. 

He was from a rural farming background and scared of being poor like his parents.

He wasn’t good at public speaking at first, but with time got good at it and started winning contests.

He started teaching a public speaking class at the YMCA. He asked the $2 a session. The director refused to pay that kind of money, thinking that it’s not a class that will be popular. It becomes an overnight sensation. P20

> Carnegie's metamorphosis from farmboy to salesman to public-speaking icon is also the story of the rise of the Extrovert Ideal. Carnegie's journey reflected a cultural evolution that reached a tipping point around the turn of the twentieth century, changing forever who we are and whom we admire, how we act at job interviews and what we look for in an employee, how we court our mates and raise our children. America had shifted from what the influential cultural historian Warren Susman called a Culture of Character to a Culture of Personality-and opened up a Pandora's Box of personal anxieties from which we would never quite recover.
> 
> In the Culture of Character, the ideal self was serious, disciplined, and honorable. What counted was not so much the impression one made in public as how one behaved in private. The word personality didn't exist in English until the eighteenth century, and the idea of "having a good personality" was not widespread until the twentieth.
> 
> But when they embraced the Culture of Personality, Americans started to focus on how others perceived them. They became captivated by people who were bold and entertaining. "The social role demanded of all in the new Culture of Personality was that of a performer," Susman famously wrote. "Every American was to become a performing self." P21

#### Extrovert Ideal

According to the cultural historian Warren Susman America changed from the Culture of Character to the Culture of Personality.

The word ‘personality’ didn’t exist in English until the 1700s.

One of the easiest ways to track this transition is via self help books, always popular in America. Pre-1920 they were mostly about ‘character’. The modesty of Abraham Lincoln was an ideal. 

In 1889 there was a manual called “Character: The Grandest Thing in the World”. In it a shop girl gave money to a homeless man and ran off because anyone could see her in the act.

But by 1920 self help books were less about inner virtue and more about outer charm. P20

#### [[Inferiority Complex]]

The Inferiority Complex (IC) was one of the first ‘fashionable’ mental conditions. It started to be retroactively applied to everyone from [[Abraham Lincoln]] to [[Napoleon]]. It was used as an all purpose explanation for many problem areas in life. P26

> The field of psychology also began to grapple with the pressure to project confidence. In the 1920s an influential psychologist named Gordon Allport created a diagnostic test of "Ascendance-Submission" t measure social dominance. "Our current civilization," observed Allport, who was himself shy and reserved, "seems to place a premium upon the aggressive person, the 'go-getter."" In 1921, Carl Jung noted the newly precarious status of introversion. Jung himself saw introverts as "educators and promoters of culture" who showed the value of "the interior life which is so painfully wanting in our civilization.” But he acknowledged that their “reserve and apparently groundless embarrassment naturally arouse all the current prejudices against this type.  
>
> But nowhere was the need to appear self-assured more apparent than in a new concept in psychology called the inferiority complex. The IC, as it became known in the popular press, was developed in the 1920s by a Viennese psychologist named Alfred Adler to describe feelings of inadequacy and their consequences. "Do you feel insecure?" inquired the cover of Adler's best-selling book, Understanding Human Nature. "Are you fainthearted? Are you submissive?" Adler explained that all infants and small children feel inferior, living as they do in a world of adults and older siblings. In the normal process of growing up they learn to direct these feelings into pursuing their goals. But if things go awry as they mature, they might be saddled with the dreaded IC-a grave liability in an increasingly competitive society.  
>
> The idea of wrapping their social anxieties in the neat package of a psychological complex appealed to many Americans. The Inferiority Complex became an all-purpose explanation for problems in many areas of life, ranging from love to parenting to career. In 1924, Collier's ran a story about a woman who was afraid to marry the man she loved for fear that he had an IC and would never amount to anything. Another popular magazine ran an article called "Your Child and That Fashionable Complex," explaining to moms what could cause an IC in kids and how to prevent or cure one. Everyone had an IC, it seemed; to some it was, paradoxically enough, a mark of distinction. Lincoln, Napoleon, Teddy Roosevelt, Edison, and Shakespeare-all had suffered from ICs. (Page 26)

#### Parenting and teaching for personality 

In the [[1920s]] schools and parents started aiming to improve children’s personalities. It was all about having a ‘winning personality’. And shyness and introversion wasn’t part of that.

#### It’s not enough to be brilliant

In the [[1950s]] Universities weren’t just focused on test results. The person had to be ‘well-rounded’, a “pretty gregarious, active type” who has done “plenty of extracurricular activities.

How true this is today, I don’t know. But it’s still presumed to be his way. When I was young lots of people did a [[Duke of Edinburgh Award]]. Not because they wanted to, but because it would make their TV “stand out”. Based on the number of kids I see doing the award each time I go to [[Ashridge]] I presume this is still the case. I remember also being told that the fact that I played rugby would help my cause when it came to jobs and University admissions.

I NEED TO HIGHLIGHT PAGE 26 - 29

#### Europe and America is more extroverted

Apparently there’s more extroverts in Europe and America. The believed reason is that their populations descend largely from migrants. Immigrants were more extroverted than average, and they passed these genes onto their kids. 


### 2. The Myth of Charismatic Leadership
#### [[Harvard Business School]]

> Between 2004 and 2006, 20% of the top three executives at the Fortune 500 companies were Harvard Business School graduates. P44

Nearly everything at HBS is done in groups. Students are put into “Learning Teams” with other students. And when you’re preparing for a class you do it in a group, not alone.

HBS is a very extroverted place. And being social in and out of class is a big part of it.

For introverted students, it can prove tough. It feels performative and exhausting. But at the end of the day, HBS does prepare students for the real world in this regard. Business in the real world is a bit sociability, peacocking and pitching:

> "Socializing here is an extreme sport," one of Don's friends tells me. "People go out all the time. If you don't go out one night, the next day people will ask, 'Where were you?' I go out at night like it's my job." Don has noticed that the people who organize social events-happy hours, dinners, drinking fests-are at the top of the social hierarchy. "The professors tell us that our classmates are the people who will go to our weddings," says Don. "If you leave HBS without having built an extensive social network, it's like you failed your HBS experience."
> 
> By the time Don falls into bed at night, he's exhausted. And sometimes he wonders why, exactly, he should have to work so hard at being outgoing. Don is Chinese-American, and recently he worked a summer job in China. He was struck by how different the social norms were, and how much more comfortable he felt. In China there was  more emphasis on listening, on asking questions rather than holding forth, on putting others' needs first. In the United States, he feels, conversation is about how effective you are at turning your experiences into stories, whereas a Chinese person might be concerned with taking up too much of the other person's time with inconsequential information.
>
> "That summer, I said to myself, 'Now I know why these are my people,'" he says.
>
> But that was China, this is Cambridge, Massachusetts. And if one judges HBS by how well it prepares students for the "real world," it seems to be doing an excellent job. After all, Don Chen will graduate into a business culture in which verbal fluency and sociability are the two most important predictors of success, according to a Stanford Business School study. P47

#### The bus to Abilene

The [[Abilene paradox]] is a collective fallacy where people in a group agree on an action that they individually disagree with, but that they go along with because they believe the group as a whole wants it, despite the vast majority of the group not wanting it.

> A well-known study out of UC Berkeley by organizational behavior professor Philip Tetlock found that television pundits—that is, people who earn their livings by holding forth confidently on the basis of limited information—make worse predictions about political and economic trends than they would by random chance. And the very worst prognosticators tend to be the most famous and the most confident—the very ones who would be considered natural leaders in an HBS classroom. The U.S. Army has a name for a similar phenomenon: “the Bus to Abilene.” “Any army officer can tell you what that means,” Colonel (Ret.) Stephen J. Gerras, a professor of behavioral sciences at the U.S. Army War College, told Yale Alumni Magazine in 2008. “It’s about a family sitting on a porch in Texas on a hot summer day, and somebody says, ‘I’m bored. Why don’t we go to Abilene?’ When they get to Abilene, somebody says, ‘You know, I didn’t really want to go.’ And the next person says, ‘I didn’t want to go—I thought you wanted to go,’ and so on. Whenever you’re in an army group and somebody says, ‘I think we’re all getting on the bus to Abilene here,’ that is a red flag. You can stop a conversation with it. It is a very powerful artifact of our culture.”
> 
> The “Bus to Abilene” anecdote reveals our tendency to follow those who initiate action—any action. We are similarly inclined to empower dynamic speakers. One highly successful venture capitalist who is regularly pitched by young entrepreneurs told me how frustrated he is by his colleagues’ failure to distinguish between good presentation skills and true leadership ability. “I worry that there are people who are put in positions of authority because they’re good talkers, but they don’t have good ideas,” he said. “It’s so easy to confuse schmoozing ability with talent. Someone seems like a good presenter, easy to get along with, and those traits are rewarded. Well, why is that? They’re valuable traits, but we put too much of a premium on presenting and not enough on substance and critical thinking.”

#### Good leaders have little 'charisma'

[[Peter Drucker]] said that good leaders can have lots of different personality types. But the one thing he noticed the good ones lack is 'charisma':

> “Among the most effective leaders I have encountered and worked with in half a century, some locked themselves into their office and others were ultra-gregarious. Some were quick and impulsive, while others studied the situation and took forever to come to a decision.… The one and only personality trait the effective ones I have encountered did have in common was something they did not have: they had little or no ‘charisma’ and little use either for the term or what it signifies.” – [[Peter Drucker]]

#### The introverted leader vs. the extroverted leader

[[Wharton School]] management professor Adam Grant looked at the outcome of a team having an introverted leader versus an extroverted one. He discovered that teams that are made of mostly passive members perform better under extroverts. But teams made up more of those who were more proactive did better with introverted leaders.

> His hypothesis was that extroverted leaders enhance group performance when employees are passive, but that introverted leaders are more effective with proactive employees...
> 
> In the first study, Grant and his colleagues analyzed data from one of the five biggest pizza chains in the United States. They discovered that the weekly profits of the stores managed by extroverts were 16 percent higher than the profits of those led by introverts—but only when the employees were passive types who tended to do their job without exercising initiative. Introverted leaders had the exact opposite results. When they worked with employees who actively tried to improve work procedures, their stores outperformed those led by extroverts by more than 14 percent.
>
> [...] Why did these leaders’ effectiveness turn on whether their employees were passive or proactive? Grant says it makes sense that introverts are uniquely good at leading initiative-takers. Because of their inclination to listen to others and lack of interest in dominating social situations, introverts are more likely to hear and implement suggestions. Having benefited from the talents of their followers, they are then likely to motivate them to be even more proactive. Introverted leaders create a virtuous circle of proactivity, in other words. In the T-shirt-folding study, the team members reported perceiving the introverted leaders as more open and receptive to their ideas, which motivated them to work harder and to fold more shirts.
>
> Extroverts, on the other hand, can be so intent on putting their own stamp on events that they risk losing others’ good ideas along the way and allowing workers to lapse into passivity. “Often the leaders end up doing a lot of the talking,” says Francesca Gino, “and not listening to any of the ideas that the followers are trying to provide.” But with their natural ability to inspire, extroverted leaders are better at getting results from more passive workers.


### 3. When Collaborations Kills Creativity
#### Studying in solitude is special

Studying and practising alone is important, and the hours spent doing it can be an indicator of success at something. 

Anders Ericsson and his colleagues did a study on violinists. They asked their music teachers to put them into “best”, “good” and “average”. They then looked at how many hours these students spent time practising alone. The results were clear. The “best” group spent 24.3 hours a day practising alone. The “average” group spent 9.3 hours a day.

They found similar effects of solitude when looking at other performers, such as chess.

Why:

> What's so magical about solitude? In many fields, Ericsson told me, it's only when you're alone that you can engage in Deliberate Practice, which he has identified as the key to exceptional achievement. When you practice deliberately, you identify the tasks or knowledge that are just out of your reach, strive to upgrade your performance, monitor your progress, and revise accordingly. Practice sessions that fall short of this standard are not only less useful—they're counterproductive. They reinforce existing cognitive mechanisms instead of improving them.
>
> Deliberate Practice is best conducted alone for several reasons. It takes intense concentration, and other people can be distracting. It requires deep motivation, often self-generated. But most important, it involves working on the task that's most challenging to you personally. Only when you're alone, Ericsson told me, can you "go directly to the part that's challenging to you. If you want to improve what you're doing, you have to be the one who generates the move. Imagine a group class you're the one generating the move only a small percentage of the time”. P81

#### Programmers work better in peace

Consultants Tom DeMarco and Timothy Lister did a study called Coding War Games to find the best of 600 programmers at 92 different companies.

The results showed the experience made no difference in who did the best, quickest work. Salary didn’t make a difference really either. Nor time spent trying to solve it.

It was mystery. But programmers from the same companies performed at more or less the same level – even though they hadn’t worked together.

The ones who did best worked at companies who gave them the most privacy, space and least amount of interruptions. P83-84

- What the programmers said:
	- Workspace was acceptably private:
		- Best performers: 62% 
		- Worst performers: 19%
	- People often interrupted them needlessly:
		- Best performers: 38%
		- Worst performers: 76%

#### Open place offices are terrible

> A mountain of recent data on open-plan offices from many different industries corroborates the results of the games. Open-plan offices have been found to reduce productivity and impair memory. They're associated with high staff turnover. They make people sick, hostile, unmotivated, and insecure. Open-plan workers are more likely to suffer from high blood pressure and elevated stress levels and to get the flu; they argue more with their colleagues; they worry about coworkers eavesdropping on their phone calls and spying on their computer screens. They have fewer personal and confidential conversations with colleagues. They're often subject to loud and uncontrollable noise, which raises heart rates; releases cortisol, the body's fight-or-flight "stress" hormone; and makes people socially distant, quick to anger, aggressive, and slow to help others. p84

#### [[Franz Kafka]] on how you have to work alone

> “You once said that you would like to sit beside me while I write. Listen, in that case I could not write at all. For writing means revealing oneself to excess; that utmost of self-revelation and surrender, in which a human being, when involved with others, would feel he was losing himself, and from which, therefore, he will always shrink as long as he is in his right mind. That is why one can never be alone enough when one writes, why there can never be enough silence around one when one writes, why even night is not night enough” – Franz Kafka

#### [[Brainstorming]] doesn't work

An advertising executive named Alex Osborn popularised(?) brainstorming. He felt his employees weren’t creative enough. He thought they had good ideas, but were loath to share them for fear of judgement.

So he came up with the four rules of brainstorming:
1. Don’t judge or criticise ideas.
2. Be freewheeling. The wilder the idea, the better.
3. Go for quantity. The more ideas you have, the better.
4. Build on the ideas of fellow group members.

He said it worked in helping people and groups produce better ideas. And it’s still used often today. But it doesn’t actually seem to work.

A study in 1963 by Marvin Dunnette at the University of Minnesota that was done on 48 3M executives and scientists showed that they produced more ideas when they brainstormed alone instead of in a group. The quality of their ideas were also ranked. And the quality of ideas thought up alone were of equal or greater quality than the group ones. P87-88

The reasons why group brainstorming is worse is likely because of:
- ‘Social loafing’. Some people tend to sit back and let others do the work. 
- ‘Production blocking’. Only one person can talk or produce an idea at once.
- ‘Evaluation apprehension’. The fear or looking stupid in front of one’s peers.

However:

> The one exception to this is online brainstorming. Groups brainstorming electronically, when properly managed, not only do better than individuals, research shows; the larger the group, the better it performs. The same is true of academic research-professors who work together electronically, from different physical locations, tend to produce research that is more influential than those either working alone or collaborating face-to-face. P89

### Is Temperament Destiny?

#### Low-reactive and high-reactive children prefers extroversion and introversion

Scientist Jerome Kegan and his team did a longitudinal study in which he followed the development of children from infancy through adolescence, documenting their physiologies and personalities along the way.

He did a series of tests on children when they were infants, two, four, seven and eleven years old. The tests would be things like balloons popping, meeting strangers or clowns. Things like their heart rate, blood pressure and more was then monitored.

If the infants responded a lot, they were put in the high reactive category. If they didn’t and were quite casual and calm, they were put in the low reactive category.

The study showed that the infants who were high-reactive were much more likely to become introverted. And the low-reactive types, extroverted.

Kegan’s team monitored heart rate, blood pressure and body temperature as it’s believed they’re controlled by the [[amygdala]]. “Located deep in the limbic system, an ancient brain network found even in primitive animals like mice and rats. This network – sometimes called the emotional brain – underlies many of the basic instincts we share with these animals, such as appetite, sex drive, and fear.” The high-reactive types had a more sensitive amygdala. P98-102

#### High-reactive has downsides and upsides

High-reactive kids are more sensitive to things like marital tension, death and abuse. If they come across them they’re more likely than low-reactive types to get depression and anxiety. 

However, when raised in stable, loving homes, they’re around 25% less likely than low-reactive kids to develop depression. Also:

> High-reactive children raised in supportive environments are even more resistant than other kids to the common cold and other respiratory illnesses, but get sick more easily if they're raised in stressful conditions. P111-112


### Beyond Temperament

#### Introverts are more sensitive to things like noise

There was a study done where introverts and extroverts had to play a challenging word game where they had to learn the principle of the game via trial and error. And all whilst wearing headphones that emitted random bursts of noise.

They were asked to set the volume “just right”. Extroverts chose 72 decibels. Introverts 55 decibels. 

When the introverts had to do the word game at the extroverts preferred noise level they underperformed, taking 9.1 trials rather than 5.8.

Full passage:

> In another famous study, introverts and extroverts were asked to play a challenging word game in which they had to learn, through trial and error, the governing principle of the game. While playing, they wore headphones that emitted random bursts of noise. They were asked to adjust the volume of their headsets up or down to the level that was "just right." On average, the extroverts chose a noise level of 72 decibels, while the introverts selected only 55 decibels. When working at the volume that they had selected-loud for the extroverts, quiet for the introverts-the two types were about equally aroused (as measured by their heart rates and other indicators). They also played equally well.
> 
> When the introverts were asked to work at the noise level preferred by the extroverts, and vice versa, everything changed. Not only were the introverts over-aroused by the loud noise, but they also underperformed-taking an average of 9.1 trials rather than 5.8 to learn the game. The opposite was true for the extroverts-they were under-aroused (and possibly bored) by the quieter conditions, and took an average of 7.3 trials, compared with the 5.4 they'd averaged under noisier conditions. P124


### 6. “Franklin was a politician, but Eleanor spoke out of conscience”

#### [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] and [[Eleanor Roosevelt]]

- Franklin was an extrovert. Eleanor an introvert. He was the politician. She was conscientious one.
- As Franklin climbed the political ladder Eleanor was required to do more and more social events. She strongly disliked this.
- Eleanor hired a social secretary named [[Lucy Mercer]] to help her with her engagements. Lucy was lively and outgoing. She and Franklin started a lifelong affair. Eleanor found out, but remained in the marriage. Albeit with the romantic side of the relationship gone. P130-133
- Eleanor had a very strong sense of feeling for people’s suffering. And historian Geoff Ward said “she kept at him on issues which he might, in the rush of things, have wanted to overlook.” P139
- With time she learnt to love public life. She was the first First Lady to hold a press conference, address a national convention, write a newspaper column, and appear on talk radio. P139

#### Animals are shy too

There’s plenty of animal species who have extroverted and introverted types. The former have a “just do it” approach and often survive when times are harsh. They’ll go for the prey without much thought. But later do better when times are good. They’ll take their time, so are less likely to get eaten themselves.

The introvert types are useful in a herd:

> "Suppose a herd of antelope... has a few members who are constantly stopping their grazing to use their keen senses to watch for predators. Herds with such sensitive, watchful individuals would survive better." — Elaine Aron

In the species that have both types, about 20% are the “introverted” kind. P146

#### Committees and politicians are often extroverted 

Committees and politicians are often extroverted, which can make getting them to take notice of subtle issues difficult.

When [[Al Gore]] (who is an introvert) organised the first hearings on [[global warming]] in Congress in the [[1970s]] no one paid attention. The members of Congress would have likely have been made up of the low-reactive babies, just all grown up. They need intense stimulation to get a response out of them. So the theoretical of global warming didn’t trigger any interest or response from them. Even a receding glacier wouldn’t do much to them. 

It was only when Al Gore packaged his concerns on global warming into a Hollywood documentary called [[An Inconvenient Truth (2006)]] that Congress paid some attention. P150-151

#### Introverts do small talk last

Extroverts start conversations with small talk before considering going to “deeper” subjects. Introverts are the reverse. They prefer those deeper subjects first:

> It's not that there's no small talk, observes Strickland, the leader of the gathering. It's that it comes not at the beginning of conversations but at the end. In most settings, people use small talk as a way of relaxing into a new relationship, and only once they're comfortable do they connect more seriously. Sensitive people seem to do the reverse. They "enjoy small talk only after they've gone deep," says Strickland. "When sensitive people are in environments that nurture their authenticity, they laugh and chitchat just as much as anyone else." p152
