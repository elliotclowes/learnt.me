## Overview

Bobby soxers were a subculture of young women in the [[1940s]] who were interested in popular music, especially [[Frank Sinatra]], and wore loose-fitting clothing and bobby socks. They would often wear [saddle shoes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saddle_shoe) or [loafers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slip-on_shoe).

It was the bobby socks that gave them their name. Though the girls themselves seem to have rejected the term.
