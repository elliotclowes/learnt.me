## Overview
- AKA Mop fair
- A tradition dating back to the [[Middle Ages]] where agricultural and domestic workers would be hired.
- They weren't strictly just a job [[fair]]. There was music, dancing, games and stalls selling food and goods.
- With term the hiring fair move beyond just agriculture. Craftsmen, blacksmiths, and other skilled workers also used these events to find employment.
- They were also a social event. It was a just for people to meet those of other villages.
- The term "Mop Fair" comes from the practice of servants carrying an item signifying their trade. For example, a [[shepherd]] might carry a crook, and a [[housemaid]] would carry a mop. This visual cue made it easier for employers to spot potential hires for specific jobs.
- Mop Fairs were traditionally held around [[Michaelmas]] (the feast of Saint Michael on September 29), marking the end of the harvest season. This timing was strategic, as it was a period when labor demands shifted.
- As the practise died out it became more about fun rather than business. Things like cheese rolling, greasy pole climbing and tug-of-war were added.
- There's a good song by [[Fairport Convention]] called "Hiring Fair" ([Spotify link](https://open.spotify.com/track/0OFYxTINdBBUXJINeWax3X?si=803ec8b212234f40)).
