- I don’t partake myself.
- It shouldn’t be illegal.
- I “lost” a few friends to it in my teenage years. They didn’t die or anything. They just become rather boring. Sitting around all day giggling to children’s TV programs.
- Users often like talking about how harmless it is to take. My gut:
	- It shouldn’t be taken by people younger than 18ish. It’s likely not good for their brains.
	- I’m sure it’s not good for your lungs.
	- The biggest risks are not physical, but the increase of mental disorders and lowering of motivation.
	- Overall a very, very safe [[Drug]] that hundreds of millions of people take with no harm to themselves or others (aside from supporting the awful illegal drugs trade).
