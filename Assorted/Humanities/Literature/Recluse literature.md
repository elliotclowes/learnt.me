Recluse literature (sōan bungaku) was a [[Japanese]] [[literary movement]] that it its peak in the late [[Heian period]]. 

[Perplexity.ai](https://www.perplexity.ai/search/tell-me-about-recluse-literatu-zLWMaMPwQrW3iQqT.pygLw):

> Sōan bungaku typically explores themes of solitude, simplicity, and spiritual contemplation. Writers often describe their modest living conditions, daily routines, and observations of nature. These works frequently include reflections on the impermanence of life, the folly of worldly ambitions, and the pursuit of enlightenment.

The "sōan" means "thatched hut".

It's often written in a style called zuihitsu (随筆), which has a loosely connected, train of thought nature.

[[Kamo no Chōmei]] is an example of someone who wrote recluse literature.
