I have it. I wasn't diagnosed until I was about [[30]]. Like all people who are diagnosed late I think about what could have been. How much better my career and relationships would be if I was made aware that I was [[neurodivergent]] earlier on and got help and medication.

As I'm getting older I dislike having ADHD more and more. It's hard to ignore the many, many that it negatively impacts my life. In particular I hate the [[ADHD Tax]].
