I'm sure I've crossed paths with many narcissists. But I haven't noticed. Aside from one. The Mum of my ex-girlfriend.

She was and remains the worst person I've come across. She was so horrible it was almost fascinating. _Almost_. It was pure misery having anything to do with her.

Now that I'm looking up the symptoms of narcissism, she has all of them:

- ✅ Grandiosity
- ✅ Need for Admiration
- ✅ Lack of Empathy
- ✅ Manipulative Behaviour
- ✅ Sense of Entitlement
- ✅ Arrogance and Haughtiness
- ✅ Envy
- ✅ Preoccupation with Fantasies
- ✅ Interpersonal Difficulties
- ✅ Sensitivity to Criticism

The saddest part about the condition is how it affects the people around them. My ex-girlfriend had [[autism]], as well some other issues. And those issues were, if not caused by the Mum, at the very least not helped by her.

My ex-girlfriend had [[ARFID]] (Avoidant/Restrictive Food Intake Disorder) and [[Anorexia Nervosa]], which might not have been entirely created by her Mum. But was made worse by her in my opinion.

A regret I have is that I didn't deal with the Mum better. I hadn't come across an obvious narcissist before and with hindsight I should have been firmer and less cooperative with her.
