ARFID (Avoidant/Restrictive Food Intake Disorder) is an [[eating disorder]] similar to [[anorexia nervosa]].

It's less about how the person looks and more about how food tastes or feels. People with the condition may avoid certain foods due to their texture, smell, colour, or taste. Which limits what they can eat. They might also just have a total lack of interest in food. Or have a fear of choking, vomiting, or having an allergic reaction, often stemming from a past traumatic experience related to eating.
