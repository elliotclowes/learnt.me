## Overview
- British [[law]] created in the [[1200s]] that lasted until [[1863]].
- It regulated the price, weight, and quality of [[bread]] and [[beer]] which were staples of the [[Medieval]] diet.
- It was the first law in British history which regulated the production and sale of food.
- The assize adjusted the weight of the bread according to the price of wheat, so when the price of grain increased, the weight of a loaf fell.
- It didn't just control prices, but quality too.
- The punishments for violating the law could be harsh. If a baker cheated on the weight of their bread they could be put in the [[pillory]].
- There was a job called "ale-conner" or "ale-taster". These officials were in charge of testing the quality of the beer. One method of testing involved sitting in a puddle of beer. If it was good their breeches would stick to the puddle.
- The term "lord of the manor" originated from this time, as lords had the responsibility to enforce the Assize of Bread and Ale in their domains.
- The Assize helped in standardizing measures and weights in England, an important step towards the development of a national market and trade practices.
- The concept of a "baker's dozen" (13 instead of 12) originated from the strict penalties imposed on bakers for shortchanging customers. To avoid punishment, bakers would give an extra loaf when selling a dozen.
