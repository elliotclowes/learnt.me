Codeine is a pain killer. It’s commonly sold mixed with paracetamol. It’s a useful drug for minor pain.

But if you have to take a high dose of codeine for more major pain it’s less useful. In high doses it can make you itchy, constipated and nauseated. But more than that, at higher dosages it just tends to bring on a certain  lethargy that’s tough to explain. It’s like an unpleasant tiredness and numbness.

You could also take codeine recreationally for pleasure. I suppose there are worse drugs to be into. Opioids are of course addictive. But from a health stand point they are one of the least damaging drugs out there. And codeine is nearly always safely made by a pharmaceutical company and not it someone’s kitchen. But if you are taking it for pleasure I presume you’d be taking the higher doses. And as I mentioned in the paragraph above, that has a lot of downsides. Also in the UK at least it’s usually sold with paracetamol in it. And the paracetamol is more unhealthy than the codeine. And sustained usage of it is rather bad for you.
