I have it. I wasn't diagnosed until I was about [[30]]. Like all people who are diagnosed late I think about what could have been. How much better my career and relationships would be if I was made aware that I was [[neurodivergent]] earlier on and got help and medication.

As I'm getting older I dislike having ADHD more and more. It's hard to ignore the many, many that it negatively impacts my life. In particular I hate the [[ADHD Tax]].

And one of the things I dislike the most is how it affects my relationship with books. I love reading and learning new things. But reading with ADHD is when I feel most like it’s a _disability_. I struggle to maintain focus on what I’m reading and I forget things very easily. I have to take extensive notes and review them often just to retain _some_ of that I’ve read.

## Tips

- Set reasonable expectations for yourself. You're might never cook dinner from scratch every night. You're never going to be a productivity beast. If you ask too much of yourself you're always going to feel down about yourself.
- Utilise time blocking.
- Ask just three tasks for yourself each day. A small, medium and large one.
- Make yourself a coffee and _then_ start cleaning. You will move **fast** knowing that coffee is getting cold, and will get the task done in no time at all. (via [clowes.blog](https://clowes.blog/2024/06/14/cleaning-tip-for.html))
