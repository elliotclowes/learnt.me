Executive functions are high-level cognitive processes that help people to plan, organise, make decisions, pay attention, and regulate behaviour. People with [[ADHD]] often have executive dysfunction.

Imagine your brain as a bustling office. Executive function is the CEO, making decisions, prioritising tasks, and keeping everything running smoothly.

But what if the CEO goes missing?

That's executive dysfunction. It's not about intelligence or desire. It's about the bridge between knowing and doing.

People with executive dysfunction have a brilliant team of employees (skills and knowledge) but no one to direct traffic. They see the destination but can't plot the course.

It's having a calendar but forgetting to check it. It's knowing you need to start but finding yourself scrolling instead. It's a to-do list gathering dust while urgent tasks pile up.

Executive dysfunction isn't laziness. It's a misfiring of the brain's control centre.

Having it can be incredibly frustrating and saddening. You know what you need to do and how important it is, but you just can't. And you feel awful about it as a result. It haunts and hounds you, but yet you're frozen with inactivity.
