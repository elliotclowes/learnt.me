Taijin kyofusho is a [[Japanese]] culture-specific [[syndrome]] "characterised by an intense fear of offending or embarrassing others through one's appearance, bodily functions, or social behaviour".

"Often considered a form of [[social anxiety]], but with a unique focus on avoiding harm to others rather than embarrassment to oneself.Â Sufferers are excessively concerned about displeasing or inconveniencing others with their presence or actions."
