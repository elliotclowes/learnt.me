(£75 | 2024-01) Just bought.

(£205 | 2023-02) I really like the look of these. My wardrobe is pretty green these days. So having some green shoes is nice. The only issue is that I baby these too much and don't wear them often enough.

### [997](https://www.asos.com/new-balance/new-balance-997-trainers-in-navy/prd/20958931?custref=71316714&affid=25199&channelref=email&orderref=815946570)[°](https://elliotclowes.com/cold/2024/https__www.asos.com_new-balance_new-balance-997-trainers-in-navy_prd_20958931_custref=71316714&affid=25199&channelref=email&orderref=815946570.html)

(£95 | 2023-02) These were too small for me and I forgot to return them, like an idiot. I really should sell them.

### [Fresh Foam Arishi](https://www.asos.com/new-balance/new-balance-fresh-foam-arishi-trainers-in-black-and-white/prd/24002000?custref=71316714&affid=25199&channelref=email&orderref=723246619)[°](https://elliotclowes.com/cold/2024/https__www.asos.com_new-balance_new-balance-fresh-foam-arishi-trainers-in-black-and-white_prd_24002000_custref=71316714&affid=25199&channelref=email&orderref=723246619.html)

(£41 | 2022-04) A little big for me as I got a size 12.5. But these are the most comfortable shoes I've ever owned. Very breathable, so your feet do get freezing if it's cold outside though.

### Fresh Foam Beacon v2 (MBECNGR2)
![[new-balance-MBECNGR2.jpg|250]]

(£90 | 2020-05) I purchased these after I hit my knee whilst running and wanted to see if trainers with a high heel would help. It didn't, sadly.

(£125 | 2015-06) Classics.

(£65 | 2014-09) These were ugly and a bit too small for me. I don't know why I didn't return them.

### MR993GL
![[new-balance-MR993GL.jpeg|250]]

(£38 | 2013-05) Classics. These lasted for years. And I forgot I got them for £38. What a bargain!

### 410
![[new-balance-410.jpeg|250]]

(£30 | 2012-09) Bought these because they were cheap. They were poorly made and the fit was too narrow. I gave them to my [[Dad]] who got a few years use out of them.

![[new-balance-mo1000.jpg|250]]

(£70 | 2011-11) These served me well on my walks at [[Ashridge]] for quite a few years. I can't remember why I got rid of them. I don't know if they broke or not.
