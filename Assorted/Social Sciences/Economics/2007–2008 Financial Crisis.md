A global economic melt down. It started in the [[US]] and spread around the world.

I was around 17 at the time it happened it never really affected me.

To be honest nearly all my knowledge of it comes from [[The Big Short (2015)]]. I read the book on it too. But I can't remember the details. That's the good thing about film. It makes things easier to remember â€“ at least for me.
