Where people with [[ADHD]] struggle to start tasks. Even if those tasks are important or urgent.

Common causes:
- Overwhelmed by the number or size of tasks.
- Fear of not being able to do the task perfectly or adequately.
- Just being uninterested in the task at end.

I have this, and often struggle to start tasks. Especially if I have too many tasks due or they seem too big. I simply feel overwhelmed. I feel like it's a different thing to [[Executive Dysfunction]] â€“ though that is also often the reason I don't start a task. I help combat it by using techniques like [[J3T (Just 3 Things)]]. I also find it easier if the task has a tight deadline or if someone is waiting on me to finish the task.
