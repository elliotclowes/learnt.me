I'm lucky that I don't have a propensity for depression. I would say I have a propensity for melancholy (And I don't mean that as a euphemism). I just can get a little low some time to time. But it's certainly not clinical depression.

And it's nearly all environmental. It's due to lack of movement, poor food and stress. And it's quick to fix. It's of my own making, rather than being forced upon me.

Hopefully that doesn't change, as 'proper' depression sounds truly awful.
