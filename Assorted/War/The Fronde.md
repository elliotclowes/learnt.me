## Overview (GPT-4)

- **Definition and Origin**: The Fronde (1648-1653) was a series of civil wars in [[France]] during the minority of [[Louis XIV]]. The name "Fronde" means "sling" in French, a reference to the slings used by street boys to break the windows of supporters of Cardinal Mazarin, the chief minister.

- **Two Distinct Phases**: The Fronde consisted of two main parts: the Fronde Parlementaire (1648-1649), led by the Parliament of Paris and focused on constitutional reform, and the Fronde des Princes (1650-1653), a more dangerous and violent affair led by the nobles.

- **Against Absolutism and Mazarin**: The Fronde was essentially a reaction against the increasing centralisation of royal power and the unpopular policies of Cardinal Mazarin, who was ruling France in the name of the young Louis XIV.

- **Involvement of the Young Louis XIV**: Louis XIV, who was a teenager during the Fronde, was twice driven out of Paris. This instilled in him a lifelong distrust of Paris and the nobility, influencing his decision to move his court to [[Palace of Versailles]] later.

- **Role of Barricades and Mocking Plays**: The Fronde saw the erection of barricades in the streets of Paris, and satirical plays mocking the royal government were popular among the rebels.

- **Participation of Women**: Women, including nobles like the Duchess of Longueville, played significant roles in the Fronde, influencing key decisions and participating actively in the conflicts.

- **Economic Turmoil and Daily Life Disruption**: The Fronde caused significant economic disruption and hardship for ordinary people, with the constant unrest and fighting leading to inflation and food shortages.

- **End and Failure**: The Fronde ended without achieving its main goals. It failed to substantially limit royal authority, and Cardinal Mazarin returned to power, paving the way for Louis XIV's absolute monarchy.

- **Long-term Impact on French Monarchy**: The Fronde had a profound impact on the young Louis XIV, shaping his policies as king, including his decision to weaken the power of the nobility and his move to Versailles to distance the court from the unrest of Paris.

- **Unusual for Absence of Ideological Basis**: Unlike many civil wars, the Fronde was unusual in that it lacked a clear ideological or religious basis, being more about the power struggle between different factions and the monarchy.
