It kills a lot of men this. My [[Grandad Jim]] died from it pretty young. And my [[Nan Pat]] always made me promise that I'd get regular tests for it as early as I could. And I will keep that promise.

I've heard that one of the unspoken issues that comes from surviving it is the [[Sexual Intercourse|sexual]] issues. As it can be very hard to get an erection if the prostate is removed (even partially). So not only have you had [[Cancer]], but you can no longer have penetrative sex. Not fun.
