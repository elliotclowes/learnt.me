What a wonderful, and wonderfully successful, [[Drugs|drug]].

It is insane to me the number of people who are reliant and addicted to it. And I do wonder how many people are in a unhealthy cycle of abuse when it comes to caffeine. They drink it too close to bed, so [don't get good](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/caffeine-may-delay-rem-sleep-alter-blood-flow-to-the-brain) [[sleep]], so they rely on it the next day.

Having said that, it appears to be perfectly healthy (with a few exceptions). And when taken in [[Coffee|coffee]] form it is actively good for you.

## Assorted info
- People with [[ADHD]] often get sleepy after caffeine, rather than energised. I have ADHD, but it doesn't make me sleepy. Though I wouldn't say it gives me a bolt of energy either.
- It wasn't until the age of about [[16]] that I discovered that lots of fizzy drinks have caffeine in them. So I had lots of [[Insomnia|insomnia]] when I was younger. I would drink [[Coca-Cola]] near bed time totally unaware of what was in it.
- I am very sensitive to caffeine. A small cup of [[Coffee|coffee]] four hours after waking will make it difficult for me to sleep. Even [[Chocolate|chocolate]] close to bed will keep me up. As a result I largely drink decaffeinated coffee.
- Caffeine is the [world's fourth most widely used drug](https://www.thrillist.com/drink/nation/caffeine-facts-things-you-didn-t-know-about-caffeine), after [[tobacco]], [[alcohol]], and [[Marijuana]].
- German chemist Friedlieb Ferdinand Runge first isolated caffeine in [[1819]] from rare [[Coffee]] beans gifted by writer [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe]].
