My favourite todo list app. I've tried plenty of others down the years but [Todoist](https://todoist.com/) has always remained my favourite. Because:
- Simple, clean UI.
- You can write to create due dates, priority, etc.
- Website and cross-platform.
	- Alternatives like [Things](https://culturedcode.com/things/) don't have that. I can be pretty sure that whatever platform I'm on, Todoist is on there.
- It just *agrees* with me.
- It gets regular updates. They're monthly newsletter are actually something I like to read.
- There were also very early to the whole idea of all their employees being [[WFH]], anywhere in the world.
