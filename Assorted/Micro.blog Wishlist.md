- The ability to add notes to books on the 'Bookshelves'
	- I like to include who or where I got the recommendation from.
- Option to have 'Show Categories' and 'Show Cross-posting' on by default.
	- It's annoying having to click on them both each time.
- In the Micro.blog app it doesnâ€™t show if a post has had replies to it or not.
- When I changed the domain of my blog auto cross-posting stopped working.
