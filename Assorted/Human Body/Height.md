## Me

I'm actually not 100% sure how tall I am. I really should measure myself. But I think I'm somewhere between 6'3" and 6'4".

## Society

From what I hear, if you're a man over 6'0" you have a distinct advantage when it comes to [[dating]]. And it seems like a women have an odd requirement of their potential partner meeting that 6'0" limit.

Lots of women like to feel 'small' compared to their partner. And from an evolutionary perspective a woman having a large man to protect and hunt makes sense. And of course there's just "bigger is better".

But it seems it's less about those things and more about an arbitrary minimum number that women feel is required for some unknown reason.

I think a large reason is bragging rights to their friends. They can proudly say that they have a boyfriend taller than 6'0".

Men are very aware of this requirement. And it seems like lots of men who are somewhere between 5'9" and 5'11" just say they're 6'0".
