I’ve loved Field Notes for many, many years. Even during when I’ve had little interest in note taking by hand or stationary I’ve still seen the value in a small, slim, well made notebook.

## Where to buy in the UK?

Sadly the official Field Notes website doesn’t have a UK store. But there are a plethora of UK online shops that sell them. However, price and availability varies. So you often have to have a little look around before buying. Below is a list of some of the better shops I’ve found:

- [Fat Buddha Store](https://www.fatbuddhastore.com/field-notes-m135). Maybe one of the largest selections around.
	- Postage = £4.50
	- Minimum spend for free shipping: £75
	- 3 x Original Kraft = £12.50
- [Pure Pens](https://www.purepens.co.uk/collections/field-notes). Good selection at reasonable prices.
	- Postage: £3.25
	- Minimum spend for free shipping: £30
	- 3 x Original Kraft = £12.50
- [The Journal Shop](https://www.thejournalshop.com/collections/field-notes). A more limited selection that the above and a tiny bit more expensive.
	- Postage: £3
	- Minimum spend for free shipping: £30
	- 3 x Original Kraft = £13

## Storage

Field Notes sell an official storage box (though I’m not sure if it’s sold in the UK. I must check). But you can actually buy an [Ikea Moppe](https://www.ikea.com/us/en/p/moppe-mini-storage-chest-birch-plywood-40216357/), which appears to fit the notebooks perfect. According to the [redditor who posted about it](https://www.ikea.com/us/en/p/moppe-mini-storage-chest-birch-plywood-40216357/), you can fit 246 of them in there. The aesthetic is also very similar to the official one.
