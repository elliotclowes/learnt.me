I’ve been considering unsubscribing from BecomingMinimalist. It’s the last ‘minimalist’ website I subscribe to. Minimalist blogs are for me like finance and investing blogs: repetitive. The theory behind both of them is simple enough to learn after a few weeks of reading. So after that it’s just about sticking with it. But I think it’s worth still keeping one or two blogs/forums on your radar. If only so you don’t lose sight of the theory. And also because every now and then there’s something to you.

The above is an example of that. The list is things like toiletries, Tupperware, towels, kitchen gadgets, clothing and shoes. All things that I spend a lot of time organising when I should probably be minimising. 

As someone with ADHD all of this is made more complicated. I’m not a frequent shopper. But I when I do wander into online or physical shops I have a tendency to impulse buy. 

And every single thing someone with ADHD owns has oversized effect on them compared to a neurotypical person, I’d argue. The ‘burden’ of storing it, cleaning it, and organising it is immense.

So every ADHD person should think long and hard before bringing a product into their life. It needs to be very much needed. But yet we have a propensity to impulse buy anything and everything!

So we have this unneeded product knocking around, haunting us for years, because we eventually in an overstimulated panic throw it away.

But until that overstimulated panic does come we will hand onto it. Stuffing it into the back of cupboards and closets. When we should just admit defeat and throw it away. But we don’t.

We don’t throw it away because we want to sell it and recoup some money (but we will never get around to doing so). Or we don’t throw it away because it was part of a hobby we had for 2 weeks that were adamant we’ll pick up again (we won’t). Or we don’t throw it away simply because it’s too big for a bin and we have to go to the tip.

So again, it continues to haunt us. Well it either haunts us or we forget totally about it.

I’m known in my family for ‘squirreling’ things away. Essentially pilling things up in closets instead of organising or chucking them. And when I do that one or two things happen:
- I totally forget about the item until I stumble upon it again in 6 months.
- Or I think about it twice daily. It’s difficult to explain. But it almost takes up ‘space’ in my brain. Whilst it’s unorganised in a closet my brain is ‘watching’ it or ‘tracking’ it. And as a result I’m less likely to be able to get on with work or other tasks. It’s very odd. But it definitely takes up a lot of ‘space’ in my brain.

So the linked article reminded me that I should just throw things away. Instead of moving the toiletries I don’t need from the sink, to the top of the toilet, to the rim of the bath, I should just chuck them.

And I will. At some point anyway.
