- 06:30: Awake.
- 09:05: At work. Arrived a bit late, annoyingly. 
- 13:51: Lunch. Fish cake salad from the canteen. Very good!
- 14:13: Poop. Think I made a mistake having raw red onions in my salad. I *know* I'm allergic to it or something. So why do I eat itâ€½ It makes my throat feel bad. And I'm currently getting over a sore throat thanks to a cold.
