## Methodology

I'm a big fan of Apple products. I couldn't use Windows purely because of how ugly it is. It is borderline offensive. 

## Hardware

### Desktop

My main computer is a MacBook Pro (15-inch, 2019) with 16GB of RAM and a 256GB SSD. It feels rather outdated these days, with its Intel CPU and fan. But it still works and runs everything I need from it, so I'll use it until it dies. One of the reasons I like Apple hardware is that I find it sturdy and long lasting. I've had two laptops in the last 15 years.

I use a [Logitech M570](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Logitech-Wireless-Mouse-Trackball-Windows/dp/B0042BBR2S?th=1) trackball. I really like trackballs because they play nicely with my [RSI](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/repetitive-strain-injury-rsi/) and they can be used on any surface, unlike a mouse.

I used to use mechanical keyboards and had a [Happy Hacking Keyboard Professional 2](https://www.hhkeyboard.com/uk/products/pro2) for many years. But one day at work I had to use a crappy Dell keyboard and I noticed my RSI pain lessened. Mechanical keyboards are often high and require force to hit the keys, which was causing me issues for years (unbeknownst to me). So I now prefer a thin basic keyboard. I have the [Cherry Stream TKL](https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B09N9DDX5L/).  I like that it doesn't have a numeric keypad whilst still having arrow keys.

When working at my desk my laptop is connected to two [Apple Thunderbolt Displays](https://web.archive.org/web/20130723232749/http://www.apple.com/uk/displays/specs.html). They're old and use a lot of power. But they do the trick.

My webcam is [Anker PowerConf C200](https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B09MFMTMPD/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1). I don't have any compliments or complaints for it.

The desk I use is a [IKEA Skarsta sit/stand one](https://www.ikea.com/gb/en/p/skarsta-desk-sit-stand-white-s59324818/). Though I never use the stand function. I wish it was a bit less deep and little wider.

### Mobile

My phone is an iPhone 15. I tried going case-less this time around and got Apple Care instead. It's been a failure. I've cracked both the front and back and I can't be bothered to get it fixed or pay the fee to get it sorted.

I also have an [iPad Pro](https://web-beta.archive.org/web/20151113192950/https://www.apple.com/ipad-pro/) (12.9 inch). I purchased it refurbished from Apple. And the fact that I forgot about that fact until I wrote this article speaks volumes for how reliable it has been. I use it to read articles and catch up on my RSS feed subscriptions. Though I also often also use it as a third display for my Mac using [Sidecar](https://support.apple.com/en-gb/102597). I'm impressed by it. I find it's much more reliable when plugged in to the laptop, instead of using WiFi though. It does also use quite a bit of CPU I've found. More than I would like.

### Servers

I have a self-built home server named *Zola* which was mainly built to be a Plex server. Its OS is [unRAID](https://unraid.net/), and it has a [AMD Ryzen 7 1700](https://www.amd.com/en/products/cpu/amd-ryzen-7-1700) CPU, 16GB of RAM, a [500GB SSD](https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B073SBX6TY?tag=pcp0f-21&linkCode=ogi&th=1&psc=1), 44TBXXXX of useable storage, and is housed in a [Fractal Design Define R5 Blackout Edition](https://www.fractal-design.com/products/cases/define/define-r5/black/) case. 

Another server I have is a [Synology DS1815+ NAS](https://www.storagereview.com/review/synology-diskstation-ds1815-review), with 24TB of storage. This was my main server until *Zola* came along, so its function now is as a backup server. It's about half the size of the other one so only key files are backed up to it. It also serves as a [Time Machine backup](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_Machine_(macOS)) to my MacBook via two 1TB drives in [RAID 1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_RAID_levels#RAID_1).

There's also an old Mac mini server (late 2014, 2.6GHz Dual-Core Intel Core i5, 8GB RAM, 500GB SSD) I have running which is another piece of hardware that's been superseded by *Zola* and that I should probably sell. Its only real job these days is backing up files I have on an external hard drive to [Backblaze](https://www.backblaze.com/).

I also rent a server in the cloud from [Scaleway](https://www.scaleway.com/en/dedibox/). It has a Intel Xeon E3-1230 v2, 16GB of RAM and 2x1TB HDD's. I mainly use it as a VPN (via [openvpn-install](https://github.com/Nyr/openvpn-install)), a backup server (via [SyncThing](https://syncthing.net/)) and also as a place to indulge in my video transcoding habit (via [Handbrake](https://hub.docker.com/r/jlesage/handbrake)).
