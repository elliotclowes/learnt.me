I've used a lot of different things down the years to store the data for my digital 'brain'. Too many in fact. Like many, I have a tendency to always move to the next best thing. And I also have a tendency to be maintaining more than one at once. One of the big reasons I've struggled sticking to just one is that I've never really found a tool which has done *everything* I wanted. And I can be a bit particular. My ideal digital brain and notetaking tool has these features:
- Cross-platform: mobile, desktop and web.
- Good tagging support: the way you take doesn't require multiple clicks. It needs to be fast.
- Beautiful: this has been the hurdle of many tools down the years.
- Support for more than just text: images, video, documents, webpages.
- Bookmark archiving: this has stopped me adopting many tools. The reason I've stuck with Evernote so long is because you can 'clip' a webpage and then see it in your notes. If the webpage disappears then you've still got a copy. Evernote's 'clipper' was never great. The webpage rarely looked like what it should have looked like. But it was better than nothing and having my bookmarks right there with my notes and documents was great.
- No lock-in: I hate the idea of my 'brain' being locked in a system they can't get out of if the tool ever disappears or just turns bad. Ideally everything is stored in an open or easily convertible format. In reality many of the tools I used didn't have this feature. But still, it was something I always ideally wanted.
- OCR: tagging can only get you so far for things like PDFs and images of text. It needs to be able to tell me what's inside of it.

Having these 'demands' meant that most new tools that came to market weren't for me. I would often get excited when I heard of a new one, only to realise it lacked quite a few of the features above.

One of the big reasons it's important to have just one 'source' is that you have to remember where you've stored things. Which isn't fun.

Evernote has been the closest to what I wanted. But I never loved it. And I was always keen to find an alternative.

These days these are my digital brains:
- Evernote: a legacy really. I haven't added to it really since 2021.
- Roam: this is my most used. I have a tendency to over-organise. You can tag in Roam, but that's about it. It's rather amorphous. As a result I just make notes, not fiddle.
- Obsidian.
- DevonThink: I tried to move from Evernote to DevonThink. It's the closest thing out there to Evernote I found. It being Apple-only worried me (but I've only used Apple products for years). But the switch didn't stick. There was just something 'off' about it. The software just didn't agree with me. It felt almost 90's to me somehow. But more than that it just had way too many bugs that often reared it's ugly head.
