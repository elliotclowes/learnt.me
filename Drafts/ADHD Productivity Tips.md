- If you can get a task done before it ever reaches your todo list that’s a great success.
	- Sometimes adding things to a todo list is a way of putting things off.
- Keep your todo list simple. Avoid using too many projects or tags or filters. Don’t give todos the opportunity to ‘hide’.
- Accept you’ll need more processing time than others.
	- Maybe it’s just me and my poor memory, and not an ADHD thing. But I make sure I take as many notes as I can during a meeting – as long as it’s not effecting my ability to take in what’s being said. But I also allot 10-20 minutes after the meeting to tidy my notes, add more details and create any action items from it.
	- I really do consider this a weakness. Others in the same meeting tend to take very few notes or none at all and still seem to remember better than me with my hefty notes, follow up todos and despite me often rereading my notes the next day.
- Look after your brain.
	- When I got diagnosed with ADHD my doctor said I should take fish oil supplements and make sure I have a healthy diet to help my brain as much as possible. I didn’t really take this too seriously. However, as someone who goes through phase's of mildly healthy eating and phases of very unhealthy eating boy do I notice a difference when I’m in that later stage. I would say I lose around 40% of my ability to focus, learn, motivate and just work. It is stark.
- Use bullet point writing.
	- Again, might be just me. But it keeps my writing short and to the point. And I find picking up the points of something far easier when in bullet points instead of paragraphs.
- Take advantage of the good hours or days
	- Maybe this is obvious. But when you finally do get into the focus flow don’t leave it unless you really have. Be extra vigilant about not letting distractions intrude. Don’t pick up your phone for a quick browse. Don’t quickly check when that film you want to watch is coming out. Stay in the flow.
	- And it’s in these moments that having the support of those around you helps. Your family being forgiving of you maybe missing lunch/dinner or a shopping trip or just not bothering you. I’m not quite brave enough to do this in my job yet, but in the future I’d like to cancel the more minor meetings if one pops up during the flow. 
		- I like to think my workplace is supportive. But I still think most people would be a little annoyed if I said “sorry can we rearrange this meeting, as I have ADHD and am in a rare moments of flow”.
- Back to back meetings can be ideal
	- Some people build in 15 minute buffers between meetings. I like to do this if I’m going to have meeting notes to write up. But if not I hate it. People without ADHD might be able to get some work in during that 15 minutes. But I very rarely can.
