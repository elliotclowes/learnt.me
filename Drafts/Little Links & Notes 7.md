Steve Jobs on consultants:
> "Coming in a making recommendations and not owning the results. Now owning the implementation. I think is a fraction of the value and a fraction of the opportunity to learn and get better. [As a consultant] you might get a very accurate picture [of a company]. But it's only two-dimensional. And without the experience of actualy 'doing it', you never get three-dimensional."

The more web-based approach to computing has finally engulfed me. In the past I've always liked **software**. I never wanted my to-do list, email, calendar or video player to be a bloody Chrome tab. I wanted the power features and all the delights that comes with something being software. Because the web version can never be as powerful as the dedicated software, right?

Well, there's been a meeting in the middle. Web versions have gotten better and software has gotten worse (or doesn't exist at all). And because of things like Electron, a lot of the 'software' I use these days are essentially webpages anyway. Or they offer little to no advantages over the web-based version.

And recently a threshold was reached where enough of my daily tools are now web-based that how I use my computer has changed. I work in tabs, not windows anymore. I could put Chrome in fullscreen at the start of my day and get by just fine without ever leaving it.

Previously I was constantly using `CMD + TAB` and [Mission Control](https://www.howtogeek.com/180677/mission-control-101-how-to-use-multiple-desktops-on-a-mac/). Now it's mostly just `CMD + 1/2/3/4/5` to go to a pinned tab.

Email (Gmail/Fastmail), to-dos (Todoist), calendar (Google Calendar), notes (Roam Research), video calls (Google Meet), documents/spreadsheets (Google Docs Editors) and instant messenger (Slack). These are some of my most used 'apps'. Yet they're just tabs in my browser (hell, I even used Visual Studio Code in my browser the other day).

My Mac's dock is a minimalists paradise these days. I have the Finder, Chrome, Terminal, Soulver and Spotify and that's about it. It's quite shocking to realise that if I was forced to start using a Chromebook I could actually probably do it.
