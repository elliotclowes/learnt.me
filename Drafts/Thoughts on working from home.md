I recently started a new job and for the first time in my life I've had the opportunity to work from home and I have some thoughts.



***

For:
- Cheaper.
- No train nonsense.
- Less distractions.
- Mornings/evenings are more productive.
- The day/night before a WFH day feels close to the feeling of a day before a weekend.
- You can run errands on your lunch or in the morning.
- You can eat earlier and cook a nice meal.

Against:
- Less bonds with colleagues.
	- I feel less kinship with those in Sofia and Bangalore.
- You need to be self-motivated.
- It can be hard to 'lock in'.
- You need to know how to avoid other kinds of distractions.
	- You need to set up systems to help you.

Summary:
- I like the hybrid approach.
