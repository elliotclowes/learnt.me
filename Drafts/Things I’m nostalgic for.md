## Waking up a cold, winter day.

Somehow those days were just better when I was younger. Those days were the car is frosted over. Where the dew on the ends of the grass strands sparkle. Where the heating exhausts on houses expels great large quantities of steam. They were special mornings. And identical mornings as a adult donâ€™t feel the same.
