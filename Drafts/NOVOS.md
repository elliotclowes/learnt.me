- Magnesium Malate.
	- 2-2.5 grams of magnesium malate = 300 mg of pure magnesium.
		- NOVOS Core has: "2,000 mg of magnesium malate (305 mg of magnesium, 1,220 mg of malate and the remainder H2O."
	- Not Magnesium Oxide.
	- You might have to take it in powder form as capsules aren't strong enough.
- Vitamin D3
	- 2000 â€“ 4000 IU per day.
	- You need to take Vitamin K with it.
		- "Vitamin D ensures proper uptake of calcium, while vitamin K makes sure that the calcium ends up in the right place."
- Vitamin K2
	- At least 180 ug per day.
- Calcium
	- 1,000 mg per day, split in two doses.
		- "Taking too much calcium in one time can create a high calcium peak in the blood that might accelerate calcification of the blood vessels."
- Iodine
	- 150 ug minimum
	- Take with selenium.
- Selenium yeast
	- 100 micrograms
	- Not selenium methionine.

- Vitamin A
	- 2,500 units per day.
	- In the form of retinyl palmitate.
- Choline
	- 550 mg per day.
	- "Most choline supplements are choline bitartrate. However, some people do not tolerate choline bitartrate supplements well; for example, they may become tired when taking them. One explanation for this can be that bitartrate can have a negative impact on the gut microbiome (e.g., fueling growth of specific unhealthy yeast). In that case, one can take choline chloride or choline citrate."
- **Zinc**
	- 10 to 15 mg per day.
	- Take with copper.
		- "Taking sufficient copper is especially important when you also take zinc supplements, given zinc inhibits the absorption of copper."
