- An often neglected meat. It's tasty and usually good value.
- Lamb and [[mint sauce]] is one of the worlds great food-condiment combinations.
- We eat a lot of lamb in the [[UK]] compared to other nations but it's fallen a lot down the years and centuries.
- [[Costco]] sells a two-pack of lamb shank that doesn't need refrigeration! And its shelf life is long too. Sounds (and maybe is) disgusting, but hey, it tastes good.
- **How I tend to eat lamb:**
	- Lamb shank
	- Roast potatoes
	- Yorkshire pudding
	- Peas
	- Mint sauce (lots!)
