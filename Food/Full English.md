- For me the two most 'iconic' English dishes are the Full English and the [[Sunday Roast]].
- It's very rare for me to have one for breakfast though. It's just too large. Instead I usually eat one for lunch or dinner.
- How and what I like to eat (I keep it simple):
	- 3 rashers of bacon.
	- 2 sausages.
	- 2 fried eggs.
	- Lots of beans.
