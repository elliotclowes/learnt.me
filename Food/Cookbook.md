- I like the *idea* of a cookbook.
- But for me they're not worth it.
- They take up a lot of space.
	- I'm a fan of physical books. But for me cookbooks are just too large for what they offer me.
- They're often pretty and large. But also a bit pricey as a result.
- I will just put them on the shelf and forget about them. I'm unlikely to get them out to browse.
- And if I ever want the recipe for something I'm just going to search for it. Not finger through a bunch of books.
