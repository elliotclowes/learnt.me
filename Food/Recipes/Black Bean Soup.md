## Instructions

1. **Saut√© Vegetables**: In a large pot, heat the olive oil over medium heat. Add the onion, bell pepper, and carrots. Cook until the vegetables are tender, about 5 minutes. Add the minced garlic and cook for another minute.

2. **Add Spices**: Stir in the cumin, chili powder, and paprika. Cook for about 1 minute until fragrant.

3. **Combine Ingredients**: Add the black beans, diced tomatoes, and vegetable broth to the pot. Season with salt and pepper to taste. Bring the mixture to a boil.

4. **Simmer**: Reduce the heat to low and simmer the soup uncovered for about 30 minutes. This allows the flavors to meld together.

5. **Puree (Optional)**: For a creamier soup, use an immersion blender to puree some of the soup in the pot. Alternatively, you can transfer about half of the soup to a blender, puree it, and then return it to the pot. Be careful when blending hot liquids.

6. **Add Lime Juice**: Stir in the lime juice and adjust the seasoning if necessary.

7. **Serve**: Ladle the soup into bowls and garnish with fresh cilantro. Add any other toppings of your choice, such as sour cream, avocado, or shredded cheese.

8. **Enjoy**: Serve your black bean soup hot, with a side of crusty bread or tortilla chips for added texture.

This soup is not only delicious but also very versatile. You can adjust the spices according to your preference, making it as spicy or mild as you like. It's a great meal on its own or as a starter and is perfect for both casual family dinners and special occasions. Enjoy your homemade black bean soup!
