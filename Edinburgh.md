I thought I was going to love Edinburgh. It’s right up my alley. Perfect winter/autumn location and it’s full of gothic looking buildings. But I didn’t have a massively great time.

## Notes
- I found it a little small, and ran out of things to do.
- The food was good enough, if you knew where to go. But there wasn’t an abundance of places to eat and I made the mistake of not doing my research in advance and making reservations. So each night it was a battle to find a good dinner spot.
- Everywhere indoors was busy. The streets weren’t too bad. But pubs in particular were a nightmare. Just rammed. And I went in October, not December or anything like that.
- I find a [[Harry Potter]] walking tour which was very good. Though if it was raining it would have been a different story.
- **Overall** though I think it was more my fault than the cities that I didn’t enjoy myself. For wherever reason I wasn’t in the best of moods that week. And I didn’t do enough research beforehand. It was just a cursed trip. I’m sure I could go back and have a much better time.
