## Notes

### Introduction

#### [[Rosa Parks]]

Despite being known for a defiant act that required bravery, Rosa Parks was known to be timid and shy. She was described as soft-spoken, sweet and small in stature.

I didn’t realise that the Montgomery Improvement Association arranged a boycott of the city buses after the Parks incident. It lasted 381 days. P1-2

*** 

Shyness and introversion are two different things. P12

### The Rise of the “Mighty Likeable Fellow”

#### Dale Carnegie

Dale Carnegie changed his last name to that from “Carnagey” to evoke Andrew Carnegie. 

He was from a rural farming background and scared of being poor like his parents.

He wasn’t good at public speaking at first, but with time got good at it and started winning contests.

He started teaching a public speaking class at the YMCA. He asked the $2 a session. The director refused to pay that kind of money, thinking that it’s not a class that will be popular. It becomes an overnight sensation. P20

> Carnegie's metamorphosis from farmboy to salesman to public-speaking icon is also the story of the rise of the Extrovert Ideal. Carnegie's journey reflected a cultural evolution that reached a tipping point around the turn of the twentieth century, changing forever who we are and whom we admire, how we act at job interviews and what we look for in an employee, how we court our mates and raise our children. America had shifted from what the influential cultural historian Warren Susman called a Culture of Character to a Culture of Personality-and opened up a Pandora's Box of personal anxieties from which we would never quite recover.
> 
> In the Culture of Character, the ideal self was serious, disciplined, and honorable. What counted was not so much the impression one made in public as how one behaved in private. The word personality didn't exist in English until the eighteenth century, and the idea of "having a good personality" was not widespread until the twentieth.
> 
> But when they embraced the Culture of Personality, Americans started to focus on how others perceived them. They became captivated by people who were bold and entertaining. "The social role demanded of all in the new Culture of Personality was that of a performer," Susman famously wrote. "Every American was to become a performing self." P21

#### Extrovert Ideal

According to the cultural historian Warren Susman America changed from the Culture of Character to the Culture of Personality.

The word ‘personality’ didn’t exist in English until the 1700s.

One of the easiest ways to track this transition is via self help books, always popular in America. Pre-1920 they were mostly about ‘character’. The modesty of Abraham Lincoln was an ideal. 

In 1889 there was a manual called “Character: The Grandest Thing in the World”. In it a shop girl gave money to a homeless man and ran off because anyone could see her in the act.

But by 1920 self help books were less about inner virtue and more about outer charm. P20

#### Gay cliche

> A popular 1926 sex guide observed, ”homosexuals are invariably timid, shy, retiring.” P25

#### [[Inferiority Complex]]

The Inferiority Complex (IC) was one of the first ‘fashionable’ mental conditions. It started to be retroactively applied to everyone from [[Abraham Lincoln]] to [[Napoleon]]. It was used as an all purpose explanation for many problem areas in life. P26

> The field of psychology also began to grapple with the pressure to project confidence. In the 1920s an influential psychologist named Gordon Allport created a diagnostic test of "Ascendance-Submission" t measure social dominance. "Our current civilization," observed Allport, who was himself shy and reserved, "seems to place a premium upon the aggressive person, the 'go-getter."" In 1921, Carl Jung noted the newly precarious status of introversion. Jung himself saw introverts as "educators and promoters of culture" who showed the value of "the interior life which is so painfully wanting in our civilization.” But he acknowledged that their “reserve and apparently groundless embarrassment naturally arouse all the current prejudices against this type.  
>
> But nowhere was the need to appear self-assured more apparent than in a new concept in psychology called the inferiority complex. The IC, as it became known in the popular press, was developed in the 1920s by a Viennese psychologist named Alfred Adler to describe feelings of inadequacy and their consequences. "Do you feel insecure?" inquired the cover of Adler's best-selling book, Understanding Human Nature. "Are you fainthearted? Are you submissive?" Adler explained that all infants and small children feel inferior, living as they do in a world of adults and older siblings. In the normal process of growing up they learn to direct these feelings into pursuing their goals. But if things go awry as they mature, they might be saddled with the dreaded IC-a grave liability in an increasingly competitive society.  
>
> The idea of wrapping their social anxieties in the neat package of a psychological complex appealed to many Americans. The Inferiority Complex became an all-purpose explanation for problems in many areas of life, ranging from love to parenting to career. In 1924, Collier's ran a story about a woman who was afraid to marry the man she loved for fear that he had an IC and would never amount to anything. Another popular magazine ran an article called "Your Child and That Fashionable Complex," explaining to moms what could cause an IC in kids and how to prevent or cure one. Everyone had an IC, it seemed; to some it was, paradoxically enough, a mark of distinction. Lincoln, Napoleon, Teddy Roosevelt, Edison, and Shakespeare-all had suffered from ICs. (Page 26)

#### Parenting and teaching for personality 

In the [[1920s]] schools and parents started aiming to improve children’s personalities. It was all about having a ‘winning personality’. And shyness and introversion wasn’t part of that.

#### It’s not enough to be brilliant

In the [[1950s]] Universities weren’t just focused on test results. The person had to be ‘well-rounded’, a “pretty gregarious, active type” who has done “plenty of extracurricular activities.

How true this is today, I don’t know. But it’s still presumed to be his way. When I was young lots of people did a [[Duke of Edinburgh Award]]. Not because they wanted to, but because it would make their TV “stand out”. Based on the number of kids I see doing the award each time I go to [[Ashridge]] I presume this is still the case. I remember also being told that the fact that I played rugby would help my cause when it came to jobs and University admissions.

#### Europe and America is more extroverted

Apparently there’s more extroverts in Europe and America. The believed reason is that their populations descend largely from migrants. Immigrants were more extroverted than average, and they passed these genes onto their kids.
