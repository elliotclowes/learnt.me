Nearly every restaurant in the West does [[Russian Service]] where the food is put on plates and served to diners. [[French Service]] is where each course is brought out one at a time and put on platter for diners to self-serve. [[English Service]] is where all courses are brought out at once for diners to self-serve.

Private jets actually often fly higher than commercial aircraft. According to [this commenter](https://aviation.stackexchange.com/a/67378) on StackExchange it's because:
- Private jets actually have a better power-to-weight ratio.
- It's easier to pressurize smaller cabins.
- Flying higher can help you avoid bad weather.
- There is less traffic high up so they take a more direct route.

Lots of retailers change their price based off of Amazon's price. So Amazon created an algorithm that would raise prices of products and see if others raised their prices too. If they did then Amazon would keep the new higher price. If not they would lower it again. There is a [lawsuit against them](https://techcrunch.com/2023/11/02/unredacted-ftc-suit-shows-project-nessie-price-raising-algorithm-made-amazon-1-4b/?utm_source=ceoreport.beehiiv.com&utm_medium=newsletter&utm_campaign=thursday-november-2nd&guccounter=1) over this anti-consumer practise.

I didn’t realise that [[George Orwell]] was posh. I just presumed he was working class. I also didn’t realise that is real name was Eric Blair. Maybe that’s common knowledge, but it’s news to me.

In the past the New York Times and British newspapers had different approaches when it came to foreign correspondents. The British ones wanted ‘experts’.  So once a journalist started covering a particular category or place they continued to do so indefinitely. Whereas the New York Times had a three year cap. They wanted curious, intelligent journalists who could approach a subject with a fresh eye. P619 (footnote).

Last night whilst trying to find something to watch I stumbled on “Hitler: A Career”. It was long so I decided to fast forward a bit to get a sense of it. It was footage of one of Hitler’s speeches. But not as I’d seen it before. Generally when you see footage of his speeches it’s at the crescendo, with him shouting and gesticulating. But this footage was of him just after the announcer had presented him. It was fascinating. He simply didn’t start his speech for ages. He ajusted a piece of paper but mostly he just stood there, waiting. Like a teacher waiting for a classroom to quiet down before starting. And it built up an amazing amount of tension. Before he even uttered a word the audience was basically already his. I mention this because coincidently in the book I’m righting right now mentions something similar. In World War 2 allied wartime propagandists sliced Hitler’s speaches, emphasising climatic moments to make him look mad. And the accelerated speed of newsreel footage added to the slightly comical and crazy impression of Hitler. Ron Rosenbaum – author of “Explaining Hitler”  argues that this might have contributed to people making the serious error of underestimating the threat he posed.” P629-630

I’m reading [["The 48 Laws of Power" by Robert Greene]]. There’s mention of a firework display at a party for Louis XIV in the 1660s. I didn’t realise they had fireworks back then‽ I wonder what they were like? Were they essential fancy gunpowder?

I asked GPT-4 and this is what it said:

> Certainly! Fireworks have a long history that dates back over a thousand years, with origins in China.
>
> By the time of Louis XIV in the 1660s, fireworks were indeed known in Europe. They had been introduced to Europeans through exploration and trade, and by the Renaissance, the art of pyrotechnics was being developed and refined in Italy and then spread to other parts of Europe.
> 
> Here's a brief overview of what fireworks during Louis XIV's time might have been like:
>
>1. **Composition**: Fireworks of the period were primarily composed of gunpowder (a mix of saltpeter, charcoal, and sulfur). Various metallic salts could be added to produce different colors when burned.
>
>2. **Design**: The designs were simpler than the elaborate displays we're accustomed to today. They would have included basic rockets, fountains (which spew sparks upwards), and wheels (which spin and emit sparks).
>
>3. **Color**: The range of colors would have been limited compared to modern displays. Basic colors like green (from barium) and red (from strontium) could be produced. Blue, which is tricky even with modern technology, would have been rare or absent.
>
>4. **Sound**: Loud bangs and whizzes were a significant part of early firework displays, just as they are today.
>
>5. **Safety**: The production and display of fireworks during this period would have been more dangerous than today. The quality and consistency of gunpowder could vary, leading to unpredictable results. Also, knowledge of safety practices would have been more limited.
>
>6. **Cultural Significance**: Fireworks during the time of Louis XIV were often used for royal and public celebrations. Their use was a display of wealth, power, and technical prowess. Given Louis XIV's penchant for grandeur and spectacle (he was known as the Sun King, after all), it's no surprise that he would have enjoyed a good firework display!
>
 So, in summary, while the fireworks of the 1660s might seem primitive compared to today's standards, they would still have been a wondrous and captivating sight for the people of the time.
