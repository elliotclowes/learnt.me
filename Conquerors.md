Diogo Cao. Sent by [[John II of Portugal]] (João II) to explore Africa (p11). He disappears off the historical map before reaching the southerly point of Africa. He either died

> Black-bearded and long-faced, well-built, and somewhat melancholy in expression, with 'an air of such gravity and authori ty that everyone recognised him as king', João was 'a man who commanded others and who was commanded by no one'. He was perhaps the most remarkable European monarch of the early modern age. To the Portuguese people he would pass into history as the Perfect Prince. His rival Isabella, queen of Castile and then the unified kingdom of Spain, gave him the ultimate accolade. She simply referred to him as "The Man'. João was preoccupied with 'the deep desire to do great things', and the first of the great things to which he stretched out his hand was the exploration of Africa. On his accession he embarked on an intense fiveyear period of state-funded exploration in which he hoped to fulfil two objectives: find a route to the Indies and reach the fabled kingdom of Prester John. It was Diogo Cão, erecting pillars along the west coast of Africa, to whom he had entrusted this task. p18

[[John II of Portugal]] (João II).

Prince Henry the Navigator. Following on from[[John II of Portugal]]. He sponsored exploration of the western side of Africa. 

Pêro da Covilhã. 
> He was about forty years old; a quick-witted, multi-talented adventurer of lowly birth, an adept swordsman, a loyal servant of  the Portuguese kings, and a spy. As well as Portuguese he spoke Castilian fluently, and, more valuably, Arabic, which he had probably learned from the Arab population of Spain. He had performed undercover operations for João there, and undertaken secret negotiations in Morocco with the king of Fez. p28

Portugal announced themselves to the other European powers via an attach of Ceuta, Morocco in 1415. https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portuguese_conquest_of_Ceuta

The Romans didn’t know where Africa ended in the south. P5

In the early days of the Portuguese empire expansion they had boats called, [[Caravel]]s. Possibly of Arab origin, they were small. Useful for manoeuvrability and hugging the shallow shoreline. But not so good for supplies. There would often be two to three of them on a campaign. With a handful of soldiers with crossbows. P13

This ‘exploration’ had a large religious element. These were crusades. After the fall of Constantinople in 1453 Christian Europe felt very threatened by Islam. The papacy sanctioned and gave financial concessions for a religious war by the Portuguese. Their goal was  “to invade, search out, capture, vanquish and subdue all Saracens and pagans whatsoever, and other enemies of Christ perpetual slavery”. P14

Apparently their most powerful neighbour was the Kingdom of Castile. I’ve never heard of them before. Need to do some research! P13

Africa was 50 times as big as the Iberian peninsula. P17.

The final aim was to get to the end of Africa so that they could make their way to India, where untold riches were said to lie. They couldn’t go across land due to all the Islamic countries. So they wanted to ‘outflank’ them. P17.

[[Christopher Columbus]] petitioned [[John II of Portugal]] to sponsor his expedition to reach India via the west. His theory was that the earth was round and it would be quicker to go west instead of east. He developed this idea from Florentine Paolo Toscanelli. The king didn’t like how cocky and sure he was though.

In the Middle Ages, Europe had less context with the Orient that during the Roman period. The routes had largely been lost or destroyed after the fall of the Mongol empire. And China turned inward and shut down its bordered. P26

On one expedition in 1487 to get to the bottom of Africa they had on board two men and four women who had been kidnapped on an earlier mission and taught Portuguese. The plan was to drop them off down the coast finely dressed and supplied with gold and silver to show off the wealth of Portugal and encourage the Africans to engage with them. P29
