I rate albums out of 10. I am a picky listener and tend not to even bother listening to something if I don't think it's going to be good. So most albums I listen to are pretty good. My scoring reflects this, otherwise nearly everything will be in the 7/10 to 9/10 range.

Essentially anything above 5/10 is a recommendation. A 5/10 may be 'average', but it's still a pretty great album in comparison to the vast majority of albums that exist.

Here's a rough guideline:
- [[1/10]]: Terrible.
- [[2/10]]: Bad.
- [[3/10]]: Poor.
- [[4/10]]: Okay.
- [[5/10]]: Average.
- [[6/10]]: Good.
- [[7/10]]: Great.
- [[8/10]]: Wonderful.
- [[9/10]]: Masterpiece.
- [[10/10]]: Absolute Masterpiece.
