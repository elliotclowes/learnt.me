A bit confused about this band. There's very little information about them out there. They don't even have a Wikipedia page.

## Album Reviews

### Gangster Love ([[1976]])

**Best tracks:**
- I'm at Your Mercy: romantic and full of subtle soul.
- Feel Like Making Love: soulful with a nice funky background.
- Michigan Avenue: groovy song that builds nicely as it goes.
- Got a Little Picture: pretty and romantic.
- Gangster Love (Long Version) (Bonus Track): a little long and unoriginal, but fun.

### I Choose You (formerly Blind Over You) ([[1975]])

This was an interesting listen. I was effected by the fact that the songs on the album had so few Spotify plays (aside from "Let Me Go" with 2.3 million) and that there was very little information on the band. I listened to it suspecting it of being all covers (which who knows, maybe it is) or secretly bad. But if I had discovered the album in vinyl form via a small record shop I would of listened to it thinking I'd found a secret gem. The album itself is a pleasant soul and mellow funk effort that is enjoyable, if not outstanding. **[[6.5/10]]** ([[2024-01-05]])
