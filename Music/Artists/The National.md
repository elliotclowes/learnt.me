### First Two Pages of Frankenstein (2023)

From my blog [elliot.my](https://elliot.my/478):

> I'm listening to The National's album _"First Two Pages of Frankenstein"_ ([Spotify link](https://open.spotify.com/album/5Mc6uebYtKnRc5I7bjlNB6?si=6irG24I6RGe1sAXhpFu8YQ)).
>
> I've never listened to their stuff before. Just one song: _'About Today'_ ([Spotify link](https://open.spotify.com/track/2w55zgyrG40D5ppKj4XxdK?si=fa8b2a375d664b38)), that I discovered via it being in _"[Warrior](https://www.justwatch.com/uk/movie/warrior-2011)" (2011)_.

> There was a profile of the band I bookmarked though. I didn't bother reading the article â€“ it was too long and I'm not that interested. But it said their new album was good. So here I am, checking it out.

> It's okay. I probably need to give it a second listen, as I've had it on in the background as I read and write. But currently it's a [5/10](https://learnt.me/Assorted/Scores/5-10). The songs are too dull and too similar. Oddly enough, the best song on the album is the one with Taylor Swift ([Spotify link](https://open.spotify.com/track/6INztpNwOTlfSKTuPo0HOP?si=d200b8a0e8dd4dfa)).

So, [[5/10]]
