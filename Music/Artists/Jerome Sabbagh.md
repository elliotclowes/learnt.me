### Vintage (2023)

![[vintage-cover.png|200]]

I listened to this as it was Stereophile magazine's recording of the month. I don't know why but I thought it was classical, based on the cover. But it's not. It's [[jazz]]. And it's perfectly fine, but just too dull. I could see myself putting it on in the background as I ate (perhaps at a dinner party). But that's all. There just isn't enough life here. [[3/10]].
