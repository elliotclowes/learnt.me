### For Emma, Forever Ago (2008)

![[for-emma.jpeg|200]]

I remember when this was *the* album on Tumblr when it came out. And I liked it. It had a good aesthetic to it. An autumn one (I don't think I'd ever seen the lead singer without his beanie).

I've just listened to it for the first time in many years. It's solid, but not as good as I remember. I remember it being fantastic and one of the few albums that I'd listen to that wasn't from 60s/70s. But to my 32-year-old ears it sounds merely okay. A shame. As I'm in an autumnal mode right now and was really looking forward to it. [[6/10]] - [[2024-09-10]]

- "Skinny Love"
