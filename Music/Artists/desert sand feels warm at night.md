### [水に流す](https://open.spotify.com/album/104mIyvioPTTtw2u08FB5C?si=eh13XggBQ66c8xHgWKl9ng) (2019)

Very mellow, soft and slow. It starts and ends with tracks 25 minutes and 37 minutes long. But it's actually the three tracks in the middle that are the prettiest in my opinion. Overall though I liked this. Very much a background album though. [[5/10]] ([[2024-01-08]])
