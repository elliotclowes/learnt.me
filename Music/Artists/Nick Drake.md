I know it’s almost a cliche that he was and is underrated. But it’s still true. The feel of his music is unique and wonderful. Nothing quite matches the melancholy of it. 

I hope a new generation of moody, depressive, deep-in-feeling teenagers discovers him. Sod the Smiths.

My favourite song of his is [Saturday Sun](https://open.spotify.com/track/1drLQNS9D5z9lBP4DbtO2R?si=QkqR6oQaQwyLyOiJ9Kt-JA) (especially section 1:30 - 2:20).

I didn’t realise that he was born in Burma and had an actor sister named Gabrielle Drake who had a successful screen career. Which is interesting as Nick famously struggled to perform live.

On [[2024-11-25]] it would have been 50 years since his death!
