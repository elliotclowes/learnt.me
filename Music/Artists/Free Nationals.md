### Free Nationals ([[2019]])

![[freenationals-freenationals.jpg|150]]

This album has a lot of collaborators and a lot of different musical influences that could of led to it being an unfocused mess. Instead it blends R&B, funk and rap in a wonderfully modern way. There's even some [[Daft Punk]]-sounding moments too. It loses steam a little as it goes, but this is still really good. There's also a [instrumental-only version](https://open.spotify.com/album/0NyUg6WIeB5tDIrNiQ0fU2?si=81alzsClTNW2V-5wftJs9g) that I'm looking forward to listening to.
