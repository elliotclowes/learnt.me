- I've been getting into [[Japan|Japanese]] [[ambient]] music recently â€“ my favourite so far has been [[Hiroshi Yoshimura]]. 
- This chap is a bit different to the ones I've listened to thus far. A bit more experimental and there's more textures going on and less minimal.
- My initial reaction was that he's the worse ambient Japanese I've listened to thus far. But he's growing on me. I'm currently listening to [Symbol](https://open.spotify.com/album/0ntm3YaiXVkkGitWl2XASV?si=Hs-0hWl8S5ORBVRPGx9YFQ) and it's rather nice.
- I was sad to find out he [died at 54](https://www.thewire.co.uk/news/37705/susumu-yokota-has-died) in [[2015]].
