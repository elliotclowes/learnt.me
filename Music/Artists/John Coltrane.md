### "John Coltrane and Johnny Hartman" ([[1963]])

^5cc008

A gorgeous album. I'm always on the look out for jazz that has vocals too, and this is a fine example. I've also added it to my [[Jazz#^cd5e51|list of jazz albums for people who don't like jazz]]. **[[7/10]]** ([Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/album/5e3mq4TT4RLn4VXfgKV6MU?si=BisczosZTLu40eUGWeFWrw)) ^0fb660
