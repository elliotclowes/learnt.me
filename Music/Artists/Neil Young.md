### Before and After ([[2023]])

![[Before and After (2023).jpg|150]]

Fuck yeah. I loved this. Young has chosen a selection of songs from his past – both released and unreleased – and re-recorded them. It's paired back, with just acoustic guitar, harmonica, piano and Young's aged but still lovely high-pitched voice on display. It's sunning.

It's mixed as a single track. And as a rule I dislike albums where the songs blend. It's mostly gimmicky and can make listening to individual songs jarring. But when done well it can help take the listener on more of a "journey" and help keep them engaged. And Young has achieved that here. This makes you feel like you're listening to a private, intimate concert.

The new releases by my favourite musicians from the 60s/70s I often find mostly terrible. So I admit I do have a tendency to over-egg their newer work if it isn't *terrible*. So bare that in mind. [[8/10]] ([[2024-01-05]])

**Best tracks:** Homefires / On the Way Home / A Dream that Can Last / Mother Earth
**Weak tracks:** My Heart / Mr. Soul



## EP Reviews

### [The Times](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Times_(EP)) ([[2020]])

A release of a [[COVID-19]] home concert featuring political (and some of my absolute favourite) songs. However this is mediocre. And his voice struggle on some of the songs. Most notably on "Southern Man". [[4/10]] ([[2024-01-06]])

### [Hitchhiker](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hitchhiker_(album)) ([[2017]])

I can see why this never got released at the time of recording in [[1976]]. Apparently execs at Reprise Records felt this was more a collection of demos rather than an album, and I agree. Having said that this is still a pleasant album and worth a listen if you're a Young fan. Interestingly the two best songs on this album are the only two that haven't been released or recorded on any other album: "Hawaii" and "Give Me Strength". [[6/10]] ([[2024-01-05]])

**Best tracks:** Hawaii / Give Me Strength
