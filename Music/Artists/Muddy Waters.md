### Folk Singer ([[1964]])

^d968e6

An amazing sounding album. A real audiophiles treat. He sound crisp, clear and close. As an album it starts really strong, but after a while it gets a bit same-y musically and I zoned out a tad. This is still a solid record though. And apparently it's Muddy Waters' only 'acoustic' album. **[[6/10]]** (2024-01-02)
