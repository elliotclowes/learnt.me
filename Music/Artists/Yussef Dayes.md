### Black Classical Music ([[2023]])

Drum focused modern hybrid jazz album with plenty of funk. It doesn't warrant its runtime and could do with its weaker track being removed. Also there's a bit too much random talking for my taste. This is still worth a listen though. [[5.5/10]] ([[2024-01-06]])

**Best tracks:** Birds of Paradise (great, crisp bass) / Marching Band (groovy with some nice vocals) / Woman's Touch (a [[Sade]] tribute) / Tioga Pass (I love the way this one builds)
**Weak tracks:** Pon di Plaza (a bit too poppy for me) / Early Dayes (a 30 second song of Dayes performing as a kid. Not really needed. Especially as it sounds like VHS audio)
