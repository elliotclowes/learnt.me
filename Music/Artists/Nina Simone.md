## Album Reviews

### Broadway-Blues-Ballads (1964)


### Nina Simone in Concert (1964)

![[in-concert.jpeg|200]]

There's something about how Nina delivers her voice and the instrumentation that I sometimes find annoying. And this is the case here. I found this album a little bit difficult to listen to. She's at her best on this one when she's doing the slow numbers from the best tracks list below. [[3/10]] - [[2024-07-26]]

**Best tracks:**
- "I Loves You Porgy"
- "Don't Smoke In Bed"

### Folksy Nina (1964)

![[folksy-nina.jpeg|200]]

It's *mildly* folky and massively dull. [[3/10]] - [[2024-07-26]]

**Best tracks:**
- "The Twelveth of Never"
### Nina Simone at Carnegie Hall (1963)

A simple and lovely little album. It's mostly just her and the piano. "If You Knew" is a stunning song and all of a sudden one my favourites by her. [[6/10]] - [[2024-07-26]]

**Best tracks:**
- "Theme from "Samson and Delilah": a beautifully simple piano piece.
- "If You Knew"
- "The Twelfth of Never"
- "The Other Woman / Cotton Eyed Joe"

### Nina Simone Sings Ellington (1962)

A short, pedestrian album that doesn't grab your attention. [[4/10]] - [[2024-07-26]]

**Best tracks:**
- "It Don't Mean a Thing (If It Ain't Got That Swing)"

### At the Village Gate (1962)

![[Screenshot 2024-07-26 at 11.22.45.png|200]]

[[2024-07-26]]. A melancholic album that felt fairly low energy. She tries to end it on a positive note with "Children Go Where I Send You", but there's no escaping the sadness of this album.

I got excited to here her announce a version of "The House of the Rising Sun". But I'm unsure what I think of it. It lacks some energy and anger. It's a more melancholic version. I should listen to that track again again.

It's pleasant enough, but not outstanding. Aside from the best tracks below I wouldn't rush back to listen to it again. [[5/10]] - [[2024-07-26]]

**Best tracks**:
- "He Was Too Good To Me"
- "Bye Bye Blackbird": a nice, fairly fast jazz number.
- "Brown Baby": a slow, incredibly sad number.

### Forbidden Fruit (1961)

### Little Girl Blue (1959)

![[little-girl-blue.jpeg|200]]

Listened whilst playing [[Battlefield 1]] and I was weirdly annoyed by the album. I think the beat of the songs disagreed with me. So I can't really give it an honest view. I'm sure if I listened again I wouldn't have an issue. [[6/10]] ([[2024-07-16]])

**Best tracks**:
- "He Needs Me"
