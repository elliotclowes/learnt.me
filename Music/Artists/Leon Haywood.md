## Album Reviews

### Come And Get Yourself Some (1974)

![[get-yourself-some.png|200]]

Another solid soul album from Haywood. Like "Back To Stay (1973)" it's not spectacular, but it's still pleasant, with no stinkers to be found. I would gladly play this from beginning to end again. I rather like it. [[6.5/10]] on [[2024-08-11]]. [Spotify link](https://open.spotify.com/album/4Q5sjR9gX9KmyhYOa39bYi?si=MZwLUZj_T7q8boGsafuB0A).

**Best tracks:**
- "I Want'a Do Something Freaky To You"
	- Sampled by [[Snoop Dogg]].
- "Who You Been Giving It Up To"
- "I Know What Love Is"

### Keep It In The Family (1974)

![[in-the-family.png|200]]

Not quite as strong as "Back To Stay (1973)", but still solid. "That Sweet Woman Of Mine" is a very pretty song and my favourite from the album. [[5/10]] on [[2024-08-09]]

**Best tracks:**
- "That Sweet Woman Of Mine"
- "You'll Never Walk Alone"
- "Don't Push It Don't Force It"
	- A catchy, if repetitive, song

### Back To Stay (1973)

![[back-to-stay.png|200]]

A tight 32 minute of fairly pedestrian [[soul]] music. However it's weirdly good this album. There's a charisma to it. And despite being short there's room for "Long As There's You (I Got Love)", a repetitive, building track that feels 'dirtier' then the rest of the album and is one of the better songs here, featuring some good electric guitar. [[6/10]] on [[2024-08-09]]. [Spotify link](https://open.spotify.com/album/1ZisSmUOPL7FA6hOTo56Y9?si=SSw4QlSCRwWCWS22LKSzOg).

**Best tracks:**
- "Let Them Walk"
- "One Way Ticket To Loveland"
- "Long As There's You (I Got Love)"
