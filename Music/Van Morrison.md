### Van Morrison at Shepards Bush Empire - 2023-11-27

Went to the [Shepherd's Bush Empire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shepherd%27s_Bush_Empire) to see Van Morrison with my Dad.

We rushed to get there for when the ticket said it was starting (7 PM) only to find ourselves queueing by the side door for 45 minutes like a couple of autograph hunters. I thought maybe 7 PM was the doors opening time not the concert time. But a staff member said the concert was _due_ to start at 7 PM.

Oh, another mixup. I was _certain_ I purchased standing tickets at the stage level. So I was rather surprised that we were guided by staff to seats up in the heavens. Maybe I got confused as the tickets were down as "Seated/Standing"? Anyho it worked out okay. There was a _tiny_ little bar on this level that was only a few steps away, and I got a comfortable end seat at the front of the balcony.

It was a concert for Morrison to promote his new album _"[Accentuate the Positive](https://www.vanmorrison.com/news/2023/new-album-accentuate-the-positive)"_ (a dull album). So as expected he played the whole album (I think). But as it's only an hour-long album he had time to do other stuff. I was hopeful he was going to do some of his older, frankly better, songs too. But alas he just did some songs from his second to last album (which was actually his best for quite a few years).

Other notes:

- I got the drunkest I've got for many months (and it was also my first time drinking for a month or two). Having easy access to a nice, quiet bar proved fatal. And the next morning I had an unusual hangover. I usually feel sick but don't really get a headache. This time it was the other way around.
- The problem with being in a queue is that you can't escape. When we first joined line a man very quickly had a go at two men in front of him. He didn't have a ticket. He was just mentally ill. He quickly left. And next to me in the queue was a nice man from Burnley. He was charming enough – an art teacher. But he could chat for England and after 45 minutes I'd very much had enough.
- I'd never been to [Shepherd's Bush Empire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shepherd%27s_Bush_Empire) before. I liked it. It was the good kind of run-down. Moulin Rouge run-down, you know? I'm sure it's long over due a multi-million pound makeover. But I liked its worn and weathered charm.
- Mid way through I had to tell the chap you can see between me and my Dad to turn his phone screen down during the concert. I wouldn't usually say anything. But he had the gall to have it at full brightness in a dark concert. And he was on it non-stop as soon as the show started. To be fair to him though he didn't complain. He remained on his phone but at least the brightness was done.
