### Love Is the Thing ([[1957]])

It was listening to this that I thought to myself what is the genre called that includes the likes of Nat King Cole and [[Frank Sinatra]]. Apparently it's called "Easy Listening". I'm familar with the term but didn't realise it applied to that.

Anyway, this album. It *is* easy listening. A nice listen, but just a bit boring. **[[5/10]]** ([[2024-01-03]])
