## Album Reviews

### IV ([[2016]])

A jazz album with hip-hop and various other influences. I was pleased to see how many plays this album has on Spotify considering how heavy and chaotic the jazz parts of this film are at times. Even I was a bit taken back by its heaviness at first. But this album really grew on me. I think I could do with giving it enough listen. [[5.5/10]] ([[2024-01-06]])

**Best tracks:** Times Moves Slow / Chompy's Paradise / IV
