### Heaven knows (2023)

Aside from the three stand-out tracks below this is fairly mediocre. I love PinkPatheress' sound a whole. It gives me early [[2000s]] [[Nokia]] vibes. [[4/10]] ([[2024-01-11]]) ([Spotify link](https://open.spotify.com/album/2pOEFqvfxp5uUQ8vQEmVA0?si=urjOfdVEShWvRNJXz94Gvg))

**Best tracks:** Mosquito / Nice to meet you / Boy's a liar Pt. 2
