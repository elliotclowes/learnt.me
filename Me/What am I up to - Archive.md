- On October 4th I started a new job at [News UK](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/News_UK) as a Business Analyst.
- I'm trying to get my health of track. Usually the summer months are my healthiest - a time for sun, walks and fish. But this year that never really happened. So my aim in October and November is to eat a bit better and lose a bit of weight in preparation for Christmas, so I can feast guilt-free.

- I'm back from a holiday in Malta with my girlfriend (if you want to see some pictures/video feel free to follow me on [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/elliotontoast)).
- After two weeks in sunny [[Malta]] I'm excited for the arrival of Autumn and all that brings. Rain, clouds, leafy walks, cosy TV/movies and homely food.
