- Still getting to grips with my new job at [News UK](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/News_UK) as a Business Analyst.
	- There's a lot to learn and I've hit my first 'blocks' after being there for two months now.
	- I'm really enjoying working from home two days a week. I find an office a distracting environment. So when I work from home I can get more work done. It doesn't always work like this. But I like my office days to be my meetings days and my WFH ones my deep work days.
- I'm still trying to get my health of track.
	- I've been failing though.
	- This is is probably the longest continuous time I've spent 'unhealthy'. And it's starting to show I think. I've had some stomach pain and I feel nausea sometimes. Not a good sign! I'm currently going through the healthcare system to look into it more.

- On October 4th I started a new job at [News UK](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/News_UK) as a Business Analyst.
- I'm trying to get my health of track. Usually the summer months are my healthiest - a time for sun, walks and fish. But this year that never really happened. So my aim in October and November is to eat a bit better and lose a bit of weight in preparation for Christmas, so I can feast guilt-free.

- I'm back from a holiday in Malta with my girlfriend (if you want to see some pictures/video feel free to follow me on [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/elliotontoast)).
- After two weeks in sunny [[Places/Countries/Malta]] I'm excited for the arrival of Autumn and all that brings. Rain, clouds, leafy walks, cosy TV/movies and homely food.
