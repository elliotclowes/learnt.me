My favourite genre is rock and folk from the 1960's and 1970's. But I also enjoy and have a passing interest in prog rock, classical, jazz, funk, country, blues and ambient.

Below are some of my favourite bands/musicians, kind of ranked.

## Van Morrison
He's not in vogue these days, and is maybe seen as a middling creator of decent romantic songs that are liked by the dull rank and file of the middle class. But I think some of his songs have an almost religious quality that transcend music and get to an entirely different plane. He has a certain sound, with a subtle, gentle layering that often builds, repeats and folds whilst Morrison's powerful, slightly erratic voice moves, swerves and jumps from line to line – and often syllable to syllable – in a way that I simply adore.

His finest albums are probably [Astral Weeks](https://songwhip.com/van-morrison/astral-weeks1968), [Moondance](https://songwhip.com/van-morrison/moondance1970), [Saint Dominic's Preview](https://songwhip.com/van-morrison/saintdominicspreview), [Veedon Fleece](https://songwhip.com/van-morrison/veedon-fleece) and [Into The Music](https://songwhip.com/van-morrison/into-the-music). But the good thing about Morrison is that he has few stinkers and his albums outside his artistic peak post-1970's are still certainly worth exploring, as they nearly all contain a great song or two.

If you want to get into Morrison I have [this playlist on Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/6E9TjhSqSN6EZglIGw8s2I?si=8143936c315b411d). It contains every song of his that I think isn't *actively* average, poor or just very dull. It's a good way of listening to his entire discography, but without the songs that I feel simply aren't worth your time.
