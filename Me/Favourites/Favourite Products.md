I've had my copy for many years and it's been around the world with me. I cherish it.

They also [featured](https://elliotclowes.com/cold/2024/blade-runner-deckards-whiskey-glass.jpg) [in the film](https://elliotclowes.com/cold/2024/blade-runner-deckards-whiskey-glass-2.jpg) [[Blade Runner (1982)]]. They are very wide, so they can be awkward to hold if you have small of dainty hands.

A lovely blue. Everything tastes nicer from it, for some reason. I think it might be due to how hot it gets or how the heat is distributed. I love how you can use this with any heat source. Oven, hob, grill, anything. It even cleans easily. It will also last many years. The only downside is that it's a model with a plastic handle on the lid, so there's a heat limit in the oven.

I love the balanced, clean dial. And it's thin and small, so agrees with my sensitive wrists. Put on a leather strap it's dressy enough for a wedding. But put it on something a big more rugged like a nato strap and it's a great adventure watch.

It fits in the hands wonderfully and looks fantastic. I've had mine for around 15 years and I still love them. My only complaint is that I wish the dessert spoon was a little bit more bowled.
