VERY MUCH A DRAFT RIGHT NOW

## Countries

- I wouldn't really say I have a favourite country yet. I think Italy could be a contender. But I haven't visited it enough yet to know for sure.
- It might not count as I was born and live here, but I would have to say that England is actually my favourite country.

## Cities

### [[Bruges, Belgium]]

- A [[Medieval|medieval]] city so lovely that the whole place is a [UNESCO World Heritage Site](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Heritage_Site).
- I had a desire to visit ever since watching [[In Bruges (2008)]].
- It is pretty busy *(and I went in October. It must be rammed during December)*. But a lot of people seem to visit just for the day. So at night it empties out and is wonderful. Dark, spooky and gorgeous.

### [[Paris, France]]

- I mainly booked Paris because my girlfriend had always wanted to go. But I'd heard mostly negative things about it so didn't have high hopes. But I really liked the place.
- My main advice is to not go if you're on a budget. You have to spend a decent amount in order to get a lot out of the place. You need a hotel in a nice area and to be comfortable with paying the inflated prices for the famous Parisian institutions like [[Moulin Rouge]]. Because they're pricey, but iconic and vital.

## Places

### Harry Potter Studio Tour

- I love Harry Potter. And this is a 20 drive away. So I visit every year. It's pricey at around Â£50 a ticket and you have to book well in advanced. But it's a joy.
- This year (2023) I went in the evening for the first time, so there was a lot more kids around. And that made it even more magical. Seeing them all dressed up and wandering around in wonder made it me appreciate the whole thing even more.
