## Spy Movies

I like the action ones like Bond and Bourne, but I have a particular soft-spot for more 'thinking' ones. Especially those based on the work of [John le Carr√©](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_le_Carr%C3%A9).

In general I tend to like anything that involves British upper-class men from the 1900's in tweedy suits smoking, scheming and having to use their over-alcoholed brains. I like the stuffiness and slowness of them. They're often equal parts dull and confusing. But they also have a comfortable cosiness to them. 

Rather strangely I've always fantasised about being a civil servant in the 50s/60s/70s. It seems like a world that's slow and predictable and I like that.

I would wake up at the same time every day in my drab but large home. My white vest-covered body would take a sip of water from a [lowball](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_fashioned_glass) and I'd put on my delicate, small, gold Omega watch and start my day.

After eating a tasteless bran cereal of some description for breakfast whilst listening to the BBC on the radio I'd then catch the wonderfully quiet bus at exactly 08:13 to the office through a fog hugged London. Work would be a nice combo of relaxed and rigorous.

My evenings would be made up of either quiet contemplation and drinking along with some letter and (bad) poetry writing. Or spent at either the pub or a members-only club.
