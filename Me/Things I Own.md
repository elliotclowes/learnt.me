### Home Theatre
- **Logitech - Harmony Ultimate Remote Control and Hub** (£130 | 2017-10)

### Music
- **[Denon - Home 250](https://www.denon.com/en-gb/product/wireless-speakers/denon-home-250/DENONHOME250GB.html)[°](https://elliotclowes.com/cold/2024/https__www.denon.com_en-gb_product_wireless-speakers_denon-home-250_DENONHOME250GB.html.html)** [x 2] (£165 each | 2023-12)
	- A good alternative to Sonos. Though to be honest the main reason I went the Denon route was because their speakers are heavily discounted from time to time (I got 2 for the price of 1 on this model). If I had to pay full price I would probably go with Sonos as I'm always scarred Denon is going to discontinue their smart speakers. So please buy some Denon ones to lower that chance!
	- The app you use to control the speakers is a little slow and clunky. But I recently stayed at an AirBnB that had Sonos and their app was no better.
- **Bose Computer Speakers** (c. 2009)
	- I can't remember the model, cost or even exactly when I purchased them. But these have been a loyal friend. Ultra reliable and they have a nice, big subwoofer.

	- Surprised by how much I like this, considering the high cost. Somehow things just taste nicer from it. I think it might be due to how hot it gets or how the heat is distributed. Though that  heat can get a annoying when trying to move it whilst cooking as the handles are scolding. I love this though. Nice and big. You can use it in the oven or on the hob. It cleans nicely. And it should last a long time. Worth the investment. The only downside is it's a model with a plastic handle on the lid. So there's a heat limit in the oven.
