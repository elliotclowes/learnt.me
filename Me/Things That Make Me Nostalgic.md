### Waking up a cold, winter day

Somehow those days were just better when I was younger. Those days were the car is frosted over. Where the dew on the ends of the grass strands sparkle. Where the heating exhausts on houses expels great large quantities of steam. They were special mornings. And identical mornings as a adult donâ€™t feel the same.

### [[Top Gear]]

This is quite a new one as of [[2024]]. The show is still running. But it has new presenters, rather than [[James May]], Richard Hammond and Jeremy Clarkson. They left the show after Jeremy was fired for punching a producer. So in my mind the show has finished. And it has been finished since [[2015]], so not that far off a decade now. And it first aired about two decades ago. And that's long enough for feeling of nostalgia to brew. Sure, the three of them starting doing [The Grand Tour](https://www.justwatch.com/uk/tv-series/the-grand-tour) which is basically the same as Top Gear. But it's just not the same. It's too scripted and the gaps between episodes being released is too long.

Anyway, in its prime Top Gear was one of the most unique and fun shows on British television. It was so good that you didn't need any interest in cars in order to watch it. The adventures and specials was what I especially adored.

And now when I watch them I am starting to feel that nostalgic feeling in my bones and stomach. It doesn't remind me of childhood, but it reminds me of my teenage years.

### Viva la Bam

Viva la Bam (and Jackass) was a staple of my teenage years. It fit me well. It was silly and often had skateboarding. And I had a particular love of Viva la Bam, watching it all the time on MTV. I loved how 'epic' it was. It went beyond just pranks. Bam Margera would do things like build a skatepark in his Mom's house, do a full [[US Civil War]] reenactment in his garden, or spend 24 hours in the Mall of America. When he got his own place, "Castle Bam", I wanted nothing more than to live like him. Unlimited money, time and fun, surrounded by friends. To teenage me it was utopia.

I haven't watched the show for quite a while, and I'm not sure if I will again. I caught a few minutes of it about five years ago and it was a bit of a shock to adult me. It just felt silly and scripted and Bam seems like a dick. So unlike a lot of my other nostalgic TV shows and films which I often love to rewatch I think this one will largely remain a memory. But who knows.
