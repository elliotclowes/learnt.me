## Clothing brands

- **Uniqlo**
	- Cheap, no logos and their quality control seems high.
- **Percival**
	- Expensive, so I only buy sale items. But I like the cut of their jackets which are high on the waist. The look of their clothes are often interesting. The materials they use always feel high quality.
- **Cos**
	- Logoless and minimalist. The cut of their clothes very rarely agree with my body. But when they do itâ€™s wonderful.
