- [Accidental Tech Podcast](https://atp.fm/)
    - An Apple-focused tech podcast I've listened to for many years.
- [No Such Thing As A Fish](https://www.nosuchthingasafish.com/)
    - A podcast by the minds beyond the TV show "Qi". Funny and full of facts.
- [Animal Spirits](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZgCX3KJ3XGCNSt9ynclginAZzAvgmzk3)
    - A finance podcast that doesn't take itself too seriously.
- [Ramblings](https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b006xrr2/episodes/downloads)
    - [Clare Balding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clare_Balding) walks and talks with a new person each week. The people are often interesting, but not 'famous'.
- [In Our Time](https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b006qykl/episodes/downloads)
    - A [long-running](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_Our_Time_(radio_series)) BBC podcast. It interviews three new academics each week to talk about a topic in the world of science and history.
- [What Are Your Thoughts?](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZgCX3KJ3XGDugSOCJzIrAxQxMV1osLXc)
    - Another fun finance podcast.
- [Huberman Lab](https://hubermanlab.com/)
    - A new edition to my list. It's a health podcast by [Andrew Huberman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_D._Huberman).
- [The Idea Store](https://anchor.fm/genevieve-sugrue)
    - A philosophy podcast by a professor called Michel Sugrue. Often it's just recordings of his lectures and the quality isn't always great. I don't always agree with Sugrue, but he's an engaging teacher.
- [The Tim Ferriss Show](https://tim.blog/)
    - I skip the bulk of the episodes. But when they're good, they're really good.
- [Conversations with Tyler](https://conversationswithtyler.com/)
    - The economist Tyler Cowen runs the blog [Marginal Revolution](https://marginalrevolution.com/). This is his podcast. He has a unique interviewing style which is no frills but gets right to the point and he gets a lot out of a person in just an hour.
