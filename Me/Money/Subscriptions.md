## Yearly

- Backblaze: $99/yr
- FastMail: $46/yr
	- My email provider. I'm not a huge fan of Gmail. And I'm happy to pay for email.
	- Technically I pay $138 once every three years.
- Overcast: £9/yr

## Monthly

- ChatGPT: $20/mo
	- I use ChatGPT a lot and I think GPT-4 is worth paying for.
- Dropbox: £10/mo
- Feral: £10/mo
- iCloud+: £9/mo
- Readwise: $9/mo
- Linode: $8.40/mo
	- This for a small little server than a lot of my websites are hosted on (the other ones are hosted on AWS). I really hope I can stay with this plan for as long as possible because the next size up (that isn't just some extra RAM) would cost me about $28.
- AWS: £3-6/mo
- Narwhal 2: £4/mo
- Ivory for Mastodon: £2/mo
- BACchus: £1/mo
