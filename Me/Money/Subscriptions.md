## Current subscriptions

- **Poe**: $20/**mo** | $240/yr
	- I use AI quite a lot and think the cost is worth it, despite the high price.
- **Linode**: $12/**mo** | $144/yr
	- This for a small little server that a lot of my websites are hosted on (the other ones are hosted on AWS). I really hope I can stay with this plan for as long as possible because the next size up (that isn't just some extra RAM) would cost me about $28.
- **Dropbox**: £10/**mo** | £120/yr
- **OneProvider**: €11.50/**mo** | €138/yr
- **iCloud+:** £9/**mo** | £108/yr

- **Micro.blog**: $5/**mo** | $60/yr
- **Narwhal 2**: £4/**mo** | £48/yr
- **FastMail**: $3.83/mo | $46/**yr**
	- My email provider. I'm not a huge fan of Gmail. And I'm happy to pay for email.
	- Technically I pay $138 once every three years.
- **1Password**: $3.59/mo | $43.06/**yr**
- **Trakt**: $2.50/mo | $30/**yr**
- **BACchus**: £1/**mo** | £12/yr

- [[2024-09-27]] - **[Tinylytics](https://tinylytics.app/)**: $6/**mo** | $72/yr
- [[2024-06-15]] - Linode: $8.40/mo
	- I've had to upgrade to the $19/mo plan as my websites were going down as the server would often run out of RAM. It's a shame. I really wanted to avoid the price increase and I've been on the same plan for years. But when your websites are crashing you don't have a choice.
- [[2024-04-22]] - ChatGPT: $20/mo
	- I now use [Poe](https://poe.com/) instead, which let's you use lots of different AI's, not just OpenAI ones. And it's the same price.
- [[2024-03-11]] - Ivory for Mastodon: £2/mo
	- I don't use Mastodon enough and this app *that* much better than the standard (and free) Mastodon app.
