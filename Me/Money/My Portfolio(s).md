## Pension

I have two pensions. A [Vanguard Personal Pension (SIPP)](https://www.vanguardinvestor.co.uk/what-we-offer/personal-pension/personal-pension-account) that I top up with a little bit of money myself. And one via work that's with [The People's Pension](https://thepeoplespension.co.uk/).

The Peoples Pension has a [limited set of funds](https://thepeoplespension.co.uk/pension/basics/investments/investment-funds/) (which is probably a good thing for the average person). So my allocation is:
- 80% - ["Global Investments fund"](https://thepeoplespension.co.uk/pension/basics/investments/investment-funds/global-investments-up-to-100-percent-fund-factsheet/)
- 20% - "[Ethical Fund](https://thepeoplespension.co.uk/pension/basics/investments/investment-funds/ethical-fund-factsheet/)"
