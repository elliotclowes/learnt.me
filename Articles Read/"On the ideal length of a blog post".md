> These thoughts on the ideal post length also reminded me of what [[John Gruber]] once said, I think, on an episode of [The Talk Show](https://daringfireball.net/thetalkshow/).[1](https://thejollyteapot.com/2023/11/28/on-the-ideal-length-of-a-blog-post#footnote-1PFJ) I’ve searched for it but I can’t seem to find this episode, which was released maybe 3-4 years ago. If I remember correctly, he was saying that he was fine with really short “link posts” and with really long posts on Daring Fireball.

> In the long, proper columns, he felt that he really expressed everything he wanted, while in the short ones, he felt that the quick comment format was a great way to link to something without having to articulate complex ideas. But the posts between something like 400 and 700 words were the ones that he felt were trouble. They were not concise enough to be considered comments, or not detailed enough to convey all he had to say.
