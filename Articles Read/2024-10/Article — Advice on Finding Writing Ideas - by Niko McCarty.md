Err on the side of publishing your idea, even if you think it’s unoriginal or not very good. If the idea/execution flops, at least you have a data point to learn from.

I wanted to understand human progress (link </span><a data-omnivore-anchor-idx="127" href="https://blog.rootsofprogress.org/motivation" rel="">#1</a><span data-omnivore-anchor-idx="128">, </span><a data-omnivore-anchor-idx="129" href="https://blog.rootsofprogress.org/smart-rich-and-free" rel="">#2</a><span data-omnivore-anchor-idx="130">). I knew that in order to discover the roots of progress, I needed first to understand *what* progress even consisted of. What is there to be explained? I had only a vague idea of what the Industrial Revolution even consisted of: steam engines, steel, trains, I dunno, textile machines? What were those things? Why are they the things that mattered? What else was there? I started out trying to find a one-book overview or summary of the industrial age. I couldn't find one. I found a summary of the Industrial Revolution but it was very episodic, a bunch of disconnected vignettes, not a unified overview/narrative. Still, it gave me several pieces of a puzzle, even if they weren't all put together. So, I just started picking off topics that I knew were important. Steam? OK, read a history of the steam engine. Cotton? Read a history of cotton. Etc. And then I started writing about what I was learning. First just little notes and open questions, like “</span><a data-omnivore-anchor-idx="131" href="https://blog.rootsofprogress.org/what-is-charcoal" rel="">What is Charcoal?</a><span data-omnivore-anchor-idx="132">” Then one day I read a book that had enough of a coherent narrative that I could summarize it and make a </span><a data-omnivore-anchor-idx="133" href="https://blog.rootsofprogress.org/turning-air-into-bread" rel="">nice longer post</a><span data-omnivore-anchor-idx="134">. People (my friends, who were my only audience at the time) liked that. So I decided to do more posts that told a whole story. Some of these, I had to do more than read one book, because the book wouldn't answer my questions. I would read a book, then do extra research to create a narrative, then </span><a data-omnivore-anchor-idx="135" href="https://blog.rootsofprogress.org/instant-stone-just-add-water" rel="">write a post</a><span data-omnivore-anchor-idx="136">. At a certain point I could start asking </span><a data-omnivore-anchor-idx="137" href="https://blog.rootsofprogress.org/relationship-of-the-scientific-and-industrial-revolutions" rel="">big questions</a><span data-omnivore-anchor-idx="138">. Later I would be able to </span><a data-omnivore-anchor-idx="139" href="https://blog.rootsofprogress.org/science-and-the-industrial-revolution" rel="">give preliminary answers</a><span data-omnivore-anchor-idx="140">. Eventually I am philosophizing about the nature of progress—what I set out to understand ~seven years ago.</span></p><ol data-omnivore-anchor-idx="141"><li data-omnivore-anchor-idx="142"><p data-omnivore-anchor-idx="143">So to more directly answer your question, once you have a Big Question, it's easy to find lots of stuff to write about because there are so many specific sub-sub-questions you can investigate. Once I wanted to understand the history of technology and industry, every major invention or industrial process was something I could write about. Every chart on Our World in Data had a story behind it I could tell. Etc. And I didn't feel that I had to master a topic before writing about it. I was OK to write about anything I learned about, once I had learned it, or to summarize things I had read and comment on them. So the whole learning process could become a series of posts, rather than the post coming *after* all the learning. If I could try to generalize this in a way that might be applicable to others, it's something like:</p><ol data-omnivore-anchor-idx="144"><li data-omnivore-anchor-idx="145"><p data-omnivore-anchor-idx="146">Find a big, burning question that you are dying to answer. Something very ambitious in scope is good. (If you don't have this: read about and try all kinds of stuff until something catches you and you become obsessed.)</p></li><li data-omnivore-anchor-idx="147"><p data-omnivore-anchor-idx="148">Set out to become an expert in the topic, in order to answer your Big Question. Start bottom up, with the very basic, object-level questions. Be humble at first, know that you know nothing to start and have a ton to learn.</p></li><li data-omnivore-anchor-idx="149"><p data-omnivore-anchor-idx="150"><span data-omnivore-anchor-idx="151">As you learn, write about what you are learning. Any time you learn a cool thing that you'd like to tell people, just write it up. Any time you read a piece that taught you something or was worthwhile, summarize it and comment on it. (Book reviews make great posts.) Don't feel you have to master the topic before you start writing; work in public (“with the garage door up”: </span><a data-omnivore-anchor-idx="152" href="https://notes.andymatuschak.org/Work_with_the_garage_door_up" rel="">https://notes.andymatuschak.org/Work_with_the_garage_door_up</a><span data-omnivore-anchor-idx="153">)</span></p></li><li data-omnivore-anchor-idx="154"><p data-omnivore-anchor-idx="155">Now you should have an endless supply of writing ideas. At first, you will just be writing about basic things and open questions, since that's where you start. Over time, you will start to see patterns and trends. And you will start to have preliminary answers to the open questions. It is like putting together a puzzle where you receive one new piece a day: at first, all you have are disconnected pieces; then you start making links; then entire connected regions form; eventually you have the whole structure in outline and you are just filling in holes. Your writing will move up the hierarchy as your learning does.</p></li><li data-omnivore-anchor-idx="156"><p data-omnivore-anchor-idx="157">By the time you have the overview, maybe it's time to write a book 😄</p></li></ol></li></ol></li><li data-omnivore-anchor-idx="158"><p data-omnivore-anchor-idx="159"><strong data-omnivore-anchor-idx="160"><span data-omnivore-anchor-idx="161">Ruxandra Tesloianu (</span><a data-omnivore-anchor-idx="162" href="https://www.writingruxandrabio.com/about" rel="">Substack Link</a><span data-omnivore-anchor-idx="163">):</span></strong><span data-omnivore-anchor-idx="164"> For better or worse, I was born with a little voice in my head that just debates whatever argument I hear from my surroundings, almost involuntarily. I often end up voicing these arguments, which does not win me many friends. On the flipside, I think it's good for writing. Most of my pieces are born out of a desire to debate whatever it is that I hear -- on a podcast, from a friend, on social media. For example, my piece: "Why haven't biologists cured cancer?" was written because I had listened to an interview with Peter Thiel where he expressed an opinion I disagreed with. I then ended up going through the history of biology to flesh out my argument. Another popular series of mine was a string of articles on luxury beliefs. This was written, again, because I disagreed with how people used the concept. I would say I try a lot as a writer to not just be argumentative and combative, but actually provide new ideas and flesh out my own framework.

When I wrote my Soviet Union series section on caloric consumption in the USSR, the puzzle there was the widespread perception that the Soviets were starving while simultaneously the UN FAO agency reporting that they were eating more calories than the US. What was going on, I wondered? In other cases, the motivation has been a hunch that someone is wrong on the internet; at first I may not know why they are wrong, but something in their writing bothered me and the writing is a means to clarify my own thinking. When I read </span><a data-omnivore-anchor-idx="172" href="https://scienceplusplus.org/metascience/" rel="">A Vision for Metascience</a><span data-omnivore-anchor-idx="173"> I was bothered by its hopeful optimism and wanted to write a more realistic take on the topic drawing on my own reading which had been ongoing for years at that point so I wrote </span><a data-omnivore-anchor-idx="174" href="https://nintil.com/metascience-limits" rel="">Limits and Possibilities of Metascience</a><span data-omnivore-anchor-idx="175">. More recently, I've been wondering whether to write a </span><a data-omnivore-anchor-idx="176" href="https://x.com/ArtirKel/status/1831495357353865652" rel="">response</a><span data-omnivore-anchor-idx="177"> to </span><a data-omnivore-anchor-idx="178" href="https://paulgraham.com/foundermode.html" rel="">Founder Mode</a><span data-omnivore-anchor-idx="179"> from Paul Graham; as I think he doesn't give the topic the justice he should given his experience at Y Combinator. More can be and should be said about Founder Mode, it seems to me, though I don't know exactly what I will say. Sometimes there seems to be something I will say but when I get to writing there isn't. That's part of the process; learning that my disagreements were minor and not worth an essay.</span></p></li><li data-omnivore-anchor-idx="180"><p data-omnivore-anchor-idx="181"><strong data-omnivore-anchor-idx="182"><span data-omnivore-anchor-idx="183">Xander Balwit (</span><a data-omnivore-anchor-idx="184" href="https://press.asimov.com/" rel="">Asimov Press</a><span data-omnivore-anchor-idx="185">)</span></strong><span data-omnivore-anchor-idx="186">: Most of my best ideas emerge from participating in (or listening to) spirited conversations with smart people. Even better, is when these are people with different domain expertise and curiosities. This collision of perspectives is a fruitful place for ideation—almost like a fusion meal, with influences coming from multiple cultures. What does statistical modeling have to say about animal welfare? What does aesthetics teach us about politics? Beyond thinking about ways to synthesize and borrow between disciplines, I cannot stress enough the importance of reading widely; a throw-away sentence or speculation posed by another author can become a whole essay.&nbsp;</span></p></li></ol><p data-omnivore-anchor-idx="187">If you have advice about how to find writing ideas, please send them to me (nsmccarty3@gmail.com) and I may update this article.</p></div></DIV></DIV>
