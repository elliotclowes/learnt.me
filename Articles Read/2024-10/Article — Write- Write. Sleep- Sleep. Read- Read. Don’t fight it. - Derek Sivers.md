<p data-omnivore-anchor-idx="4">
	Knowing I read a lot, someone recently asked how I balance learning and working.
</p><p data-omnivore-anchor-idx="5">
	When do you stop reading and get back to work?
</p><p data-omnivore-anchor-idx="6">
	When do you stop working and go learn something new?
</p><p data-omnivore-anchor-idx="7">
	Being self-employed and in control of my own schedule, I used to wrestle with this a lot.
</p><p data-omnivore-anchor-idx="8">
	I’d be so thirsty to keep reading and learning, that I’d feel bad I hadn’t done any real work in weeks.
</p><p data-omnivore-anchor-idx="9">
	Other times I’d just work, work, work for weeks without stopping to read some of the brilliant books I’d already bought.
</p><p data-omnivore-anchor-idx="10">
	Then I realized something so obvious it’s funny that I’m writing it here:
</p><p data-omnivore-anchor-idx="11">
<strong data-omnivore-anchor-idx="12">
	Stop wrestling.
	Don’t fight it.
	Go with it, either direction.
</strong>
</p><p data-omnivore-anchor-idx="13">
<strong data-omnivore-anchor-idx="14">
	If you’re excited to work, work.
</strong>
	Sneak out of bed at 4am if your toes are tapping, and go do what’s on your mind.
</p><p data-omnivore-anchor-idx="15"><strong data-omnivore-anchor-idx="16">
	But if you’re tired, don’t fight it.
	Sleep.
</strong></p><p data-omnivore-anchor-idx="17">
	If you’ve got writer’s block, <a data-omnivore-anchor-idx="18" href="https://sive.rs/book/IgnoreEverybody">enjoy the silence while it lasts</a>.
	In another day, week, or month, you’ll be so filled with things to say you’ll be sneaking out of bed again.
</p><p data-omnivore-anchor-idx="19">
	Who knows why the brain is into different things at different times.
</p><p data-omnivore-anchor-idx="20">
<strong data-omnivore-anchor-idx="21">
	But we’re so much more effective when we follow what our body wants to do, rather than trying to fight it.
</strong>
</p><p data-omnivore-anchor-idx="22">
<em data-omnivore-anchor-idx="23">
	Of course I’m writing this as a reminder to myself, because today was one of those days where I wanted to do a bunch of programming, but I was at this computer for hours and didn’t get a damn thing done.
	All I wanted to do was read on the couch.
	So I shut the laptop and read for a few hours.
	Which was just what I needed, and ended up inspiring the hell out of me, so that afterwards I jumped up and came back to programming, now more effectively.
