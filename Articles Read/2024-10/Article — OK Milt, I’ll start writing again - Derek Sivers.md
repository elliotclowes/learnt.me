<p data-omnivore-anchor-idx="8">
	Yesterday I procrastinated, tinkered, and wasted time, doing nothing of any value.
</p><p data-omnivore-anchor-idx="9">
	Then this morning, I found out that one of my best friends died yesterday.
	He was out on a bike ride on a quiet street when a car swerved into the bike lane, <a data-omnivore-anchor-idx="10" href="https://losangeles.cbslocal.com/2013/12/08/bicyclist-struck-and-killed-by-sheriffs-radio-car-in-calabasas/">killing him instantly</a>.
</p><p data-omnivore-anchor-idx="11">
	We shared my online music account.
	I see he had just downloaded the entire Bruce Springsteen and Neil Young catalog yesterday before he left on his ride.
</p><p data-omnivore-anchor-idx="12">
	I’ve been crying off and on all morning, thinking about what we do with our time — what’s worthy and what’s a waste.
</p><p data-omnivore-anchor-idx="13">
	Time really is limited.
	We can’t pretend it’s not.
	Time spent doing one thing is time spent not doing something else.
</p><p data-omnivore-anchor-idx="14">
	It’s so easy to waste time doing stuff that’s not important, not really fun, and not useful to anyone, not even yourself.
</p><p data-omnivore-anchor-idx="15">
	It’s so hard to fight the <a data-omnivore-anchor-idx="16" href="https://sive.rs/book/WarOfArt">resistance</a> to do the more difficult but more important thing.
	Finishing that book.
	Writing that song.
	Launching that project.
</p><p data-omnivore-anchor-idx="17">
	I spent this morning thinking about what doesn’t matter and what does.
	For me, writing is about the most worthy thing I can do with my time.
	I love how the distributed word is eternal — that every day I get emails from strangers thanking me for things I wrote years ago that helped them today.
	I love how those things will continue to help people long after I’m gone.
</p><p data-omnivore-anchor-idx="18">
	My friend was a brilliant conversationalist, one of the brightest minds I’ve met, but he never put his thoughts into writing.
<strong data-omnivore-anchor-idx="19">
	It’s extra-sad that his thoughts are gone, too.
</strong>
</p><p data-omnivore-anchor-idx="20">
	So this lesson is dedicated to you, Milt Olin.
	I’m going to start writing again.
