<p data-omnivore-anchor-idx="34">No matter how hard we all wish it were otherwise, the sad fact is that there aren't really individual solutions to systemic problems. For example: your personal diligence in recycling will have no meaningful impact on the climate emergency.</p>
<p data-omnivore-anchor-idx="35">I get it. People write to me all the time, they say, "What can I change about my life to fight enshittification, or, at the very least, to reduce the amount of enshittification that I, personally, experience?"</p>
<p data-omnivore-anchor-idx="36">It's frustrating, but my general answer is, "Join a movement. Get involved with a union, with EFF, with the FSF. Tell your Congressional candidate to defend Lina Khan from billionaire Dem donors who want her fired. Do something <em data-omnivore-anchor-idx="37">systemic</em>."</p>
<p data-omnivore-anchor-idx="38">There's very little you can do as a consumer. You're not going to shop your way out of monopoly capitalism. Now that Amazon has destroyed most of the brick-and-mortar <em data-omnivore-anchor-idx="39">and</em> digital stores out of business, boycotting Amazon often just means doing without. The collective action problem of leaving Twitter or Facebook is so insurmountable that you end up stuck there, with a bunch of people you love and rely on, who all love each other, all hate the platform, but can't agree on a day and time to leave or a destination to leave <em data-omnivore-anchor-idx="40">for</em> and so end up stuck there.</p>
<p data-omnivore-anchor-idx="41">I've been experiencing some challenging stuff in my personal life lately and yesterday, I just found myself unable to deal with my usual podcast fare so I tuned into the videos from the very last XOXO, in search of uplifting fare:</p>
<p data-omnivore-anchor-idx="42"><a data-omnivore-anchor-idx="43" href="https://www.youtube.com/@xoxofest">https://www.youtube.com/@xoxofest</a></p>
<p data-omnivore-anchor-idx="44">I found it. Talks by Dan Olson, Cabel Sasser, Ed Yong and many others, especially Molly White:</p>
<p data-omnivore-anchor-idx="45"><a data-omnivore-anchor-idx="46" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTaeVVAvk-c">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTaeVVAvk-c</a></p>
<p data-omnivore-anchor-idx="47">Molly's talk was so, so good, but when I got to her call to action, I found myself pulling a bit of a face:</p>
<blockquote data-omnivore-anchor-idx="48"><p data-omnivore-anchor-idx="49">
  But the platforms do not exist without the people, and there are a lot more of us than there are of them. The platforms have installed themselves in a position of power, but they are also vulnerable…
</p></blockquote>
<p data-omnivore-anchor-idx="50">Are the platforms <em data-omnivore-anchor-idx="51">really</em> that vulnerable? The collective action problem is <em data-omnivore-anchor-idx="52">so</em> hard, the switching costs are <em data-omnivore-anchor-idx="53">so</em> high – maybe the fact that "there's a lot more of us than there are of them" is a bug, not a feature. The more of us there are, the thornier our collective action problem and the higher the switching costs, after all.</p>
<p data-omnivore-anchor-idx="54">And then I had a realization: the conduit through which I experience Molly's excellent work <em data-omnivore-anchor-idx="55">is</em> totally enshittification-proof, and the more I use it, the easier it is for <em data-omnivore-anchor-idx="56">everyone</em> to be less enshittified.</p>
<p data-omnivore-anchor-idx="57">This conduit is anti-lock-in, it works for nearly the whole internet. It is surveillance-resistant, far more accessible than the web or any mobile app interface. It is my secret super-power.</p>
<p data-omnivore-anchor-idx="58">It's RSS.</p>
<p data-omnivore-anchor-idx="59">RSS (one of those ancient internet acronyms with multiple definitions, including, but not limited to, "Really Simple Syndication") is an invisible, automatic way for internet-connected systems to public "feeds." For example, rather than reloading the <em data-omnivore-anchor-idx="60">Wired</em> homepage every day and trying to figure out which stories are new (their layout makes this <em data-omnivore-anchor-idx="61">very</em> hard to do!), you can just sign up for <em data-omnivore-anchor-idx="62">Wired</em>'s RSS feed, and use an RSS reader to monitor the site and preview new stories the moment they're published. <em data-omnivore-anchor-idx="63">Wired</em> pushes about 600 words from each article into that feed, stripped of the usual stuff that makes <em data-omnivore-anchor-idx="64">Wired</em> nearly impossible to read: no 20-second delay subscription pop-up, text in a font and size of your choosing. You can follow <em data-omnivore-anchor-idx="65">Wired</em>'s feed without any cookies, and <em data-omnivore-anchor-idx="66">Wired</em> gets no information about which of its stories you read. <em data-omnivore-anchor-idx="67">Wired</em> doesn't even get to know that you're monitoring its feed.</p>
<p data-omnivore-anchor-idx="68">I don't mean to pick on <em data-omnivore-anchor-idx="69">Wired</em> here. This goes for every news source I follow – from CNN to the <em data-omnivore-anchor-idx="70">New York Times</em>. But RSS isn't just good for the news! It's good for <em data-omnivore-anchor-idx="71">everything</em>. Your friends' blogs? Every blogging platform emits an RSS feed by default. You can follow every one of them in your reader.</p>
<p data-omnivore-anchor-idx="72">Not just blogs. Do you follow a bunch of substackers or other newsletters? They've <em data-omnivore-anchor-idx="73">all</em> got RSS feeds. You can read those newsletters without ever registering in the analytics of the platforms that host them. The text shows up in black and white (not the sadistic, 8-point, 80% grey-on-white type these things all default to). It is <em data-omnivore-anchor-idx="74">always</em> delivered, without any risk of your email provider misclassifying an update as spam:</p>

<p data-omnivore-anchor-idx="75">Did you know that, by default, your email sends information to mailing list platforms about your reading activity? The platform gets to know if you opened the message, and often how far along you've read in it. On top of that, they get all the private information your browser or app leaks about you, including your location. This is <em data-omnivore-anchor-idx="76">unbelievably</em> gross, and you get to bypass <em data-omnivore-anchor-idx="77">all</em> of it, just by reading in RSS.</p>
<p data-omnivore-anchor-idx="78">Are your friends too pithy for a newsletter, preferring to quip on social media? Unfortunately, it's pretty hard to get an RSS feed from Insta/FB/Twitter, but all those new ones that have popped up? They all have feeds. You can follow any Mastodon account (which means you can follow any Threads account) via RSS. Same for Bluesky. That also goes for older platforms, like Tumblr and Medium. There's RSS for Hacker News, and there's a sub-feed for the comments on every story. You can get RSS feeds for the Fedex, UPS and USPS parcels you're awaiting, too.</p>
<p data-omnivore-anchor-idx="79">Your local politician's website probably has an RSS feed. Ditto your state and national reps. There's an RSS feed for each federal agency (the FCC has a great blog!).</p>
<p data-omnivore-anchor-idx="80">Your RSS reader lets you put all these feeds into folders if you want. You can even create automatic folders, based on keywords, or even things like "infrequently updated sites" (I follow a bunch of people via RSS who only update a couple times per year – cough, Danny O'Brien, cough – and never miss a post).</p>
<p data-omnivore-anchor-idx="81">Your RSS reader doesn't (necessarily) have an algorithm. By default, you'll get everything as it appears, in reverse-chronological order.</p>
<p data-omnivore-anchor-idx="82">Does that remind you of anything? Right: this is how social media used to work, before it was enshittified. You can single-handedly disenshittify your experience of virtually the entire web, just by switching to RSS, traveling back in time to the days when Facebook and Twitter were more interested in showing you the things you <em data-omnivore-anchor-idx="83">asked</em> to see, rather than the ads and boosted content someone else would pay to cram into your eyeballs.</p>
<p data-omnivore-anchor-idx="84">Now, you sign up to so many feeds that you're feeling overwhelmed and you <em data-omnivore-anchor-idx="85">want</em> an algorithm to prioritize posts – or recommend content. Lots of RSS readers have some kind of algorithm and recommendation system (I use News, which offers both, though I don't use them – I <em data-omnivore-anchor-idx="86">like</em> the glorious higgeldy-piggeldy of the undifferentiated firehose feed).</p>
<p data-omnivore-anchor-idx="87">But <em data-omnivore-anchor-idx="88">you</em> control the algorithm, <em data-omnivore-anchor-idx="89">you</em> control the recommendations. And if a new RSS reader pops up with an algorithm you're dying to try, you can export all the feeds you follow with a single click, which will generate an OPML file. Then, with one click, you can import that OPML file into <em data-omnivore-anchor-idx="90">any other RSS reader in existence</em> and all your feeds will be seamlessly migrated there. You can delete your old account, or you can even use different readers for different purposes.</p>
<p data-omnivore-anchor-idx="91">You can access RSS in a browser or in an app on your phone (most RSS readers have an app), and they'll sync up, so a story you mark to read later on your phone will be waiting for you the next time you load up your reader in a browser tab, and you won't see the same stories twice (unless you want to, in which case you can mark them as unread).</p>
<p data-omnivore-anchor-idx="92">RSS basically works like social media <em data-omnivore-anchor-idx="93">should</em> work. Using RSS is a chance to visit a utopian future in which the platforms have no power, and all power is vested in publishers, who get to decide what to publish, and in readers, who have total control over what they read and how, without leaking <em data-omnivore-anchor-idx="94">any</em> personal information through the simple act of reading.</p>
<p data-omnivore-anchor-idx="95">And here's the <em data-omnivore-anchor-idx="96">best</em> part: every time you use RSS, you bring that world closer into being! The collective action problem that the publishers and friends and politicians and businesses you care about is caused by the fact that everyone they want to reach is on a platform, so if they leave the platform, they'll lose that community. But the more people who use RSS to follow them, the less they'll depend on the platform.</p>
<p data-omnivore-anchor-idx="97">Unlike those largely useless, performative boycotts of widely used platforms, switching to RSS doesn't require that you give anything up. Not only does switching to RSS let you continue to follow all the newsletters, webpages and social media accounts you're following now, it makes doing so <em data-omnivore-anchor-idx="98">better</em>: more private, more accessible, and less enshittified.</p>
<p data-omnivore-anchor-idx="99">Switching to RSS lets you experience just the good parts of the enshitternet, but that experience is delivered in manner that the new, good internet we're all dying for.</p>
<p data-omnivore-anchor-idx="100">My own newsletter is delivered in fulltext via RSS. If you're reading this as a Mastodon or Twitter thread, on Tumblr or on Medium, or via email, you can get it by RSS instead:</p>
<p data-omnivore-anchor-idx="101"><a data-omnivore-anchor-idx="102" href="https://pluralistic.net/feed/">https://pluralistic.net/feed/</a></p>
<p data-omnivore-anchor-idx="103">Don't worry about which RSS reader you start with. It literally doesn't matter. Remember, you can switch readers with two clicks and take all the feeds you've subscribed to with you! If you want a recommendation, I have nothing but praise for Newsblur, which I've been paying $2/month for since 2011 (!):</p>
<p data-omnivore-anchor-idx="104"><a data-omnivore-anchor-idx="105" href="https://newsblur.com/">https://newsblur.com/</a></p>
<p data-omnivore-anchor-idx="106">Subscribing to feeds is super-easy, too: the links for RSS feeds are invisibly embedded in web-pages. Just paste the URL of a web-page into your RSS reader's "add feed" box and it'll automagically figure out where the feed lives and add it to your subscriptions.</p>
<p data-omnivore-anchor-idx="107">It's still true that the new, good internet will require a movement to overcome the collective action problems and the legal barriers to disenshittifying things. Almost nothing you do as an individual is going to make a difference.</p>
<p data-omnivore-anchor-idx="108">But using RSS will! Using RSS to follow the stuff that matters to you will have an immediate, profoundly beneficial impact on your own digital life – and it will appreciably, irreversibly nudge the whole internet towards a better state.</p>
