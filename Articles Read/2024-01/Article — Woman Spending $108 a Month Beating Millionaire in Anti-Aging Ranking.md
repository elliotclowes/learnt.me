Maybe it doesn't take millions of dollars, over 100 daily supplements, and a team of 30 doctors to combat the aging process.

Millionaire Bryan Johnson has made a name for himself with his [rigorous health routines](https://www.businessinsider.com/tech-executive-shared-two-million-daily-routine-age-reverse-2023-7) in his quest to have the biological health of someone 18 â€” which even at one point included [receiving blood transfusions](https://www.businessinsider.com/millionaire-bryan-johnson-swapped-blood-with-teenage-son-young-blood-2023-5) from his 17-year-old son. But, at least one gauge of biological aging suggests that a simpler approach might be better.

Julie Gibson Clark, a woman who [told Fortune](https://fortune.com/well/2023/11/04/longevity-women-biohackers-diet-exercise-bryan-johnson/) her biggest anti-aging expenses total out to around $108 a month, appears to be beating Johnson in the [Rejuvenation Olympics](https://rejuvenationolympics.com/). The online leaderboard was [launched](https://www.vox.com/money/23798848/deaging-longevity-billionaires-rejuvenation-olympics) by Johnson earlier this year and ranks thousands of participants on the pace of their biological aging using DNA tests over the course of six months or more.

Clark currently ranks second in the Rejuvenation Olympics, which estimates the 55-year-old woman ages about 0.665 of a year for every full year going forward. Meanwhile, 46-year-old Johnson is ranked sixth on the list and ages about 0.72 of a year.

Johnson directed Insider to a [post on X](https://twitter.com/bryan%5Fjohnson/status/1721578475759239658?s=20) regarding Fortune's story.

"It's a victory that in a [@FortuneMagazine ](https://twitter.com/FortuneMagazine)profile, speed of aging is now a topic of status, intrigue, slight, drama and competition," Johnson wrote. "Exactly why I started the Rejuvenation Olympics. Every day, every single one of us plays the game DON'T DIE; looking both ways before crossing the street, changing the smoke alarm battery. The future is becoming masters at not dying."

Clark did not immediately respond to Insider's requests for comment on the current health rankings ahead of publication.

Clark told Fortune she spends $27 per month on a gym membership and pays $79 per month for a NOVOS subscription that gives her access to supplements. The woman told the publication she is "health conscious," but is able to make it work on a salary of less than $100,000.

Like Johnson, her health routine includes fasting and working out, Clark told Fortune. The 55-year-old said she wakes up everyday between 4:45 a.m. and 5 a.m., but fasts for about 16 hours, eating her first meal of the day around 10 or 11 a.m. She spends time on cardio and strength training, meditates, and eats about 16 ounces of vegetables every day.

In the past, Johnson has detailed his [anti-aging regimen,](https://www.businessinsider.com/bryan-johnson-anti-aging-blueprint-daily-routine-habits-2023-9#:~:text=Bryan%20Johnson%20calls%20himself%20the,sleep%2C%20exercise%2C%20and%20diet.) which he has said costs him about [$2 million per year](https://www.businessinsider.com/tech-executive-shared-two-million-daily-routine-age-reverse-2023-7). He's said he follows over 200 protocols from his "Blueprint." The routine includes [eating a strict diet](https://www.businessinsider.com/bryan-johnson-biotech-ceo-anti-aging-mush-diet-project-blueprint-2023-9), involving a blend of vegetables and lentils, as well as consuming 111 supplements daily. The millionaire also said he eats all of his meals before 11 a.m. each day.

Johnson has also said he's used more eccentric methods, such as performing [shockwave therapy](https://www.businessinsider.com/bryan-johnson-longevity-braintree-anti-aging-penis-erectile-dysfunction-2023-8) on his penis or using red light therapy and ultrasounds, to try and reverse his biological age.

Ultimately, Clark told Fortune that healthy habits have to be something that can be easily folded into your daily life.

"This stuff has to just kind of be like brushing your teeth," Clark said.

Anti-aging trends have become increasingly popular in recent years. From people's interest in [Blue Zones](https://www.businessinsider.com/worlds-5-blue-zones-people-live-longest-lives-2023-3) and [anti-aging treatments](https://www.businessinsider.com/anti-aging-longevity-trends-shock-testosterone-2023-3) to the ultra-rich like Johnson, Jeff Bezos or Mark Zuckerberg who have [invested millions into longevity research.](https://www.businessinsider.com/richest-wealthiest-entrepreneurs-ceo-billionaires-tech-searching-hacking-longevity)
