Hi Fellow Explorers,

"Make Blueprint easy to do" is the top request we’ve received. We’ve now done it. The basics are ready for you. 

Blueprint is competing for the most nutritious food program in history. It is designed for adults of all ages and genders. We’re already cost-competitive with fast food. And there are many more exciting items coming soon. 

We have enough inventory from our first production run to supply 2,500 people for 90 days. You can apply today for one of these slots.

Blueprint items included for this initial group are the following:

* Longevity Mix, a 6 oz drink mix
* Eight supplements:
   * Essential Capsules
   * Essential Softgel
   * NAC+Ginger+Curcumin
   * RYR+Garlic
* Nutty Pudding (w/ nuts+blueberries), a meal
* Extra virgin olive oil, 750 mL (50 Tbsp)

Product details \[1\]

Together, these items provide you elite levels of nutrition. They equal 410 calories. As a participant, you’ll eat what you normally would each day minus \~400 calories you’re getting from the Blueprint stack.

Together, there are 67 “interventions” in these products. An intervention and its dose is selected based upon randomized controlled trials and strong epidemiological evidence.

We normally think about food as a “cost”. Blueprint is a new relationship of how we think about what we put into our body; it’s an investment in your health. The monthly amount is an investment of $333.

With this basic stack, we are competing for the most nutritious food program in history. It is designed for adults of all ages and genders. We’re already cost-competitive with fast food. And there are many more exciting products coming soon.

As a self-experimentation participant, you are invited to invest in measuring your biomarkers. Measurement can be expensive and is not always affordable or accessible for everyone, so we’ve created three tiers of measurement options: $0, \~$800 and \~$1,600\. You will choose a level when applying to be a participant.

Participants will be uploading biomarker data into a decentralized clinical trial system that will enable us to do group-level data analysis, which we will share. We will not be analyzing your individual biomarkers or providing any guidance. That will remain the role of your doctor. The objective is to quantify changes in certain biomarkers when a large group of us regularly consume Blueprint basics for 90 days.

This expands Blueprint from an n=1 to n=2,500\. It creates the foundation for many other things we can do together including adding more interventions and doing more robust quantification.

You can apply today. We will then assemble the participant cohort and begin notifying participants the week of January 15th.

Once selected, you’ll be invited to participate in a discord community \[2\] where we will work together to help everyone identify cost effective testing providers around the world. This is the first step in Blueprint becoming a bulk buying club for all things health and wellness.

It’s important that participants complete baseline measurements by the end of January to begin consuming Blueprint products in February.

We are toiling vigorously (while getting 100% sleep score) to scale capacity so that we can reliably provide monthly subscriptions to all. If you’re not part of this initial 2,500 group, we will be opening it up to others as fast as possible.

We’re also adding more food items to satisfy a day’s worth of calories and nutrition (see \[3\] for our roadmap and nutrition details). We are mindful that if you want Blueprint to be your single source of food we’ll need to satisfy your needs of variety, texture and taste. We’re on it.

Blueprint is about health and wellness. Also, it’s a secret plan to kickstart our evolution from Homo Sapiens to Homo Evolutis.

### In summary:

* You can apply to be a self-experimentation participant now.
* Participants will be notified the week of January 15th.
* Baseline measurements to be completed by the end of January.
* Begin consuming Blueprint in February.
* You’ll try to maintain similar sleep, diet and exercise habits during the 90 days to avoid confounding results. This first step is focusing on measuring nutritional changes.
* Participants can decide to invest either $0, \~$800 or \~$1,600 into measuring biomarkers.
* Participants will upload their biomarker data into a decentralized clinical trial software so that the Blueprint team can perform data analysis which will be shared.
* Those who are not selected for this initial group will have the opportunity to start Blueprint in the next month or so as we increase our production capacity.
* More Blueprint items will be introduced shortly that will satisfy an entire day’s caloric and nutritional needs.
* Blueprint is competing for the most nutritious food program in history.
* We are currently in the process of figuring out international availability. We can ship to the below 26 countries, however, the clinical trial system we’re using for data management needs to comply with the respective country's data and privacy laws. We are evaluating the path to complete that compliance in each country. For now, if you are in one of the countries below and are interested in participating, please apply and we will do our best to see if we can get the system up and running for your country.  
   * Currently shipping to the following countries: Australia, Austria, Belgium, Canada, Czech Republic, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Hong Kong SAR China, Ireland, Israel, Italy, Japan, Malaysia, Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Singapore, South Korea, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, United Arab Emirates, United States, and United Kingdom.

### Other housekeeping items:

* Vibe: we want this to be fun and feel like a game we’re playing together.
* We’re building this on the fly with you so expect there to be constant improvements, and also bumps.
* We are a very small team and won’t be able to answer general inquiries about your health or topics generally.
* You will be engaged, responsive, and attentive to this effort.

## FAQ

### How will testing be done?

You can use your existing scale or buy one for body composition. For blood work, we’re going to work as a team in the Blueprint discord channel to identify doctors and testing services around the world. For your wearable, you can use your existing device or get one from a provider such as Whoop or Oura. We’ve negotiated discounts that we will share in the discord community.

### What do you suggest for the blood panel and how much will it cost?

Below is a suggested blood panel. Costs will vary according to geography, we estimate $350-500\. You can also adjust the number of things measured based upon your budget. If the entire panel is too expensive, we’ve ranked each test to help you decide which to prioritize.

### What health tracker should I use?

You can use your existing wearable. We’ve also negotiated discounts on your behalf with Whoop and Oura. You can use your existing scale or buy Withings ([$99](https://amzn.to/3RRPsCS) or [$179](https://amzn.to/3S7RFLP)) and the [Withings blood pressure cuff](https://amzn.to/3THs11Z) (optional, $97) if blood pressure is a topic of concern.

We are working out the details of our data management system and how we will be integrating the data from these various devices. It’s possible that we’ll pull all data from Apple Health which acts as a repository for your health data. More soon.

### You: I love data and want more of it!

We understand that sentiment. Below are some additional measurements you can do. Note however, these additional measurements may or may not be able to be uploaded to our clinical trial software and or included in the group analysis. We can evaluate interest and update the community.

* Pace of Aging DNA Methylation. $270 (w/ Blueprint discount) includes two tests, before and after.
* DEXA scan for bone mineral density if risk of osteopenia or osteoporosis (or EchoLite REMS bone ultrasound for fracture risk, arguably more accurate and no radiation)
* DEXA scan for fat, visceral fat and muscle (or AMRA MRI body composition scan, no radiation and arguably more accurate, but a lot more expensive)
* NAD test [(discount](http://www.jinfiniti.com/) NAD test only) $150

### Will you collect my measurements like blood draws?
