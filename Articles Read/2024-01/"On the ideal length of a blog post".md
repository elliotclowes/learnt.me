> These thoughts on the ideal post length also reminded me of what [[John Gruber]] once said, I think, on an episode of [The Talk Show](https://daringfireball.net/thetalkshow/).[1](https://thejollyteapot.com/2023/11/28/on-the-ideal-length-of-a-blog-post#footnote-1PFJ) I’ve searched for it but I can’t seem to find this episode, which was released maybe 3-4 years ago. If I remember correctly, he was saying that he was fine with really short “link posts” and with really long posts on Daring Fireball.
