#### Two Sides to the Story

### The Fine Art of Literary Fist-Fighting: How a Bunch of Rabble Rousers, Outsiders, and Ne’er-do-wells Concocted Creative Nonfiction

## By Lee Gutkind

#####  Yale University Press 304pp £25 

This is a true story. Straight after finishing university, the man who is now my husband spent a short time as an intern in the office of the publication you are reading. His fellow intern was a sixteen-year-old boy, furiously annoyed about being there and subject to periodic check-ins from his headmaster. The name of this boy was Richard. My husband and his sixteen-year-old colleague spent their days going through the dozens of books that arrived every morning, sorting them into piles. If I had more space to flesh out this scene, I would include a long paragraph describing them rustling uneasily through shards of cardboard, dust motes swirling in the air, Richard remarking that he had never known a man to drink Diet Coke before. 

Richard and my husband came quickly to fear this job. ‘That’s non-fiction,’ my husband would say, pointing to a book about wine. ‘What’s _non-fiction_?’ Richard would say, exasperated – by the exercise, by the idea of someone reading a book about wine, by publishing itself, maybe. ‘Non-fiction’, my husband would say, ‘is when it’s not made up.’ ‘So everything in this book is true?’ Richard would say, pointing to the volume at the top of the non-fiction pile, Craig Brown’s book about Princess Margaret. ‘It’s more like it’s trying to be true,’my husband would say. ‘What?’ Richard would say. ‘It’s more like it aspires to the status of non-fiction but uses techniques we associate with the novel,’ my husband would have said, if he had been able to come up with such a definition on the spot. ‘_What?_’ Richard would have said. 

The harder my husband tried to distinguish between these categories, the less sense his explanations made to himself and the more irritable Richard became. My husband found himself tormented by a mocking inner voice as he came to realise he did not know the answers to what he had once believed were basic questions. In the end, they resorted to a mainly wordless system, where Richard would hand my husband a book, and it would be placed on a pile without further discussion.

No one really knows how to define creative non-fiction. Attempts to draw a line around it often culminate in feelings of confusion and defensiveness, and hazy ruminations on how best to represent human experience. Lee Gutkind’s _The Fine Art of Literary Fist-Fighting_ is a brief history of some of these sorts of disputes. It tells the story of how creative non-fiction came slowly to be accepted within the academy and the literary establishment after years of shabby treatment and snotty questions about its legitimacy, aims and reach. These wobbly beginnings seem quaint now, given the almost holy esteem in which writers like James Baldwin, Rachel Carson and Joan Didion are held, but, as Gutkind reminds us, the literary world is profoundly hierarchical, full of people who like knowing where they stand, who they should be looking up to and whose noses were put out of joint by the emergence of a genre that seemed to upset the established order. If it was creative, then it wasn’t non-­fiction, surely. If it was non-fiction, then which were the bits that were creative? Shouldn’t writers be obliged to tell you if and when they were just making stuff up? Michael Anderson, an editor at the _New York Times Book Review_, put it another way: ‘Creative nonfiction, I am so sick of this bullshit.’

Gutkind, who founded the first creative-­non-fiction writing MFA programme in the world, as well as the first journal devoted solely to the genre, is an engaging guide, with an endearingly long memory for slights and an acknowledged passion for self-promotion (good luck to anyone attempting to keep count of the times he refers to himself as a rebel, renegade or godfather of the genre). His version of events begins more or less with Gay Talese’s profile of the boxer Joe Louis, which appeared in _Esquire_ in 1962, and ends with creative non-fiction taking its rightful place as ‘the fourth and most active and visible genre’. In between, we have Baldwin, Capote, Carson, Didion, Dillard, Gornick, Hardwick, Malcolm, Mailer, McPhee and Wolfe, among others, as well as a handful of extremely bitchy arguments at academic conferences. My favourite was Vivian Gornick breezily announcing that _Fierce Attachments_ included an entirely invented scene depicting a confrontation between her mother and a homeless person, and Mary Karr responding to this disclosure by comparing Gornick to a deli guy who announces, ‘I just put a teaspoon of catshit in your sandwich, but you didn’t notice it at all.’ For Karr, ‘A small bit of catshit equals a catshit sandwich, unless I know where the catshit is and can eat around it.’ 

For Gutkind, creative non-fiction entails ‘writing true stories that provide information about a variety of subjects, enriched by relevant thoughtful ideas, personal insight, and intimacies about life and the world we live in’. This could mean just about anything. A definition this capacious is certainly useful when you are trying to answer questions about the nature of the genre in a manner that strongly discourages follow-ups, but it is much less helpful for anyone trying to work out what makes a piece of creative non-fiction good, moving or era-defining. It’s also of no use to someone trying to work out exactly where the line is between fiction and non-fiction, what counts as relevant information or what the difference is between personal insight and compulsively talking about yourself. If anyone is inclined to spend many hours of their life coming up with a definition of the genre that satisfies everyone, in other words, their efforts will not be wasted. A project for the summer holidays, maybe.

‘Richard’ is not the real name of the boy in the story, by the way. His real name is much funnier and stranger. The thing about Diet Coke isn’t true either. It just seemed like something the boy might have said in a version of the story of my own construction.
