Forty-two years have passed since my first visit to the Tour de France. Second-to-last stage of the 1982 race was into Aulnay-sous-Bois. Sean Kelly, the man we had come to see, got into the winning break that Saturday afternoon and as the best sprinter in a small group, he couldn’t lose. But he did. That’s sport. Next day in the centre of Paris, he asked his girlfriend to pay for our lunch. From a reluctant spender, this was true remorse.

I haven’t been to every Tour since then, just most of them. The race is less incredible now but more enjoyable, even if today’s sprinter Jasper Philipsen is not likely to pay for lunch after a bad day. After four decades, a certain familiarity with the Tour may be expected. Well, watching the second season of Netflix’s _Tour de France: Unchained_ last week, it felt like I’d never been to the race. The series is that good.

For any film director, it’s not difficult to make the Tour look good. La belle France takes care of that. It is the storytelling that is extraordinary, explaining as it does the mystery of the Tour to those coming to it for the first time while providing compelling insight for those who think they know the race. Most of all, the eight episodes explore the humanity of those involved. These are young athletes prepared to tell us what they’re thinking, sometimes seeming immature, uncool, but always real.

In early episodes, Ben O’Connor strikes us as guileless. He’s a general classification rider from Australia who cannot conceal his disappointment that his compatriot Jai Hindley has won a mountain stage and taken the Yellow Jersey. His team boss, Vincent Lavenu, tells O’Connor that the Tour de France is not some “inter-Australia race”, but the rider struggles to see any picture but the one inside his head.

By the end of the Tour, O’Connor’s transformation is complete. Out of form through the first half of the race, leadership of the AG2R team is taken from him and given to Felix Gall. Disappointed, O’Connor accepts and then rides selflessly to help the Austrian win the toughest mountain stage of the race. Racked with self-doubt, Gall is good but fragile. “I’m not sure if I can handle general classification \[GC\],” he says, “I’m stressing about it.”

The joy of _Unchained_ is that it is not fixated on the stars. We are taken inside the Soudal Quick-Step team, where the veteran boss, Patrick Lefevere, grows ever more agitated with their failure to win a stage, reminding everybody that in their various iterations the team have won at least one stage every year since 1992\. Lefevere complains that the team’s best-paid rider Julian Alaphilippe earns a lot of money (£1.94 million) and needs to do better.

Alaphilippe tries, but doesn’t have the legs. Then, on a wondrous but bizarre leg to Bourg-en-Bresse three days from the end, his team-mate Kasper Asgreen escapes in a four-man break and wins. As memorable as Asgreen’s victory was Alaphilippe’s contribution to it. Getting to the front of the speeding peloton, he slowed, disrupted the rhythm of the pursuit, buying precious seconds for his team-mate.

Netflix eloquently tells the story of Pello Bilbao’s emotional victory into Issoire, inspired by the death of his close friend and Bahrain Victorious team-mate Gino Mäder after a crash at the Tour of Switzerland three weeks before. Crossing the line and pointing to the sky, Bilbao said he just let go “all of the anger that was inside” and remembered “the reason for this win, the special one, for Gino”.

At another moment we’re inside the Ineos-Grenadiers team, listening as the team directors Rod Ellingworth and Steve Cummings talk about what to do about Tom Pidcock and the issue of team leadership. It is clear to them that their Spanish rider Carlos Rodriguez is in better shape than Pidcock and more likely to stay in the GC race. They need Pidcock to ride for Rodriguez and Cummings undertakes to tell him.

The conversation takes place during the rider’s massage.

Cummings explains the reason for the change in strategy. The rider’s reluctance to agree is obvious. The team director says he needs to commit and invites him to say he will. Pidcock tells the camera to stop filming, which made plain his response. “Tom, you can use a lot of adjectives to describe,” Rodriguez says with thinly veiled disapproval. Pidcock rides his own race when he should have been helping Rodriguez and then, a day later, he cracks and drops like an anchor down the classification table. “I was targeting everything and I came away with nothing,” Pidcock says. “It kind of felt like a waste of two weeks.”

Pidcock has won world titles at mountain biking and cyclocross, he’s the reigning Olympic champion at mountain biking and says he wants to win the Tour de France. He is a supremely talented bike rider and a fiercely ambitious individual. Everyone agrees he’s a winner but, watching Netflix’s second season, what struck me is that Pidcock is denying himself one of life’s greatest joys. The gift blesses the giver.

There’s a moment on the Jumbo-Visma team bus at San Sebastián that continues to flash upon the inward eye. The second stage has just ended with the French rider Victor Lafay breaking clear close to the finish. The defending champion, Jonas Vingegaard, is disgusted with himself. He climbs on the bus, sees Wout van Aert and stops, patting his team-mate on the shoulder: “I’m sorry, I should have done better.” Vingegaard could have neutralised Lafay’s attack but hesitated. His team-mate Van Aert lost a stage he might have won. “It’s OK,” Van Aert said, accepting the apology.

These insights are precious. And, thankfully, the film-makers were never going to leave out Matej Mohoric’s reaction to victory at Poligny two days from the end. He beat Asgreen by less than the width of a tyre and offered an almost philosophical perspective five minutes after crossing the line: “It’s hard and cruel to be a professional cyclist. You sacrifice your life, your family. You know what everyone else is going through and then, at the end, you almost feel you betrayed them because you beat them.”

The Tour begins in Florence on Saturday. It’s the waiting that’s hard.
