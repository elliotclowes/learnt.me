# Article text
In the early 2000s we netizens used to find things by hypertext. Sure, you’d go to web directories like Yahoo! to look for a starting point, usually based on a topic or theme. The true fun was when eventually you’d find a seam and start digging. An interesting website led to links to other interesting websites. A blog would have comments from other bloggers. You would visit the sites of these other bloggers, following more and more of them over time. Via all of these places you were paying attention to, you’d start to find more curiosities: opinion pieces, travelogues, recipes, media shares, personal stories, etc.

It wasn’t the most efficient way from point A to point B, but also you weren’t there to get to a specific destination. You were on the web to explore and discover. It seemed limitless the things you could uncover. It still is–even more so!

In light of Google recently announcing their bizarre all-in on AI “search,” [Manu writes about the importance of curation](https://manuelmoreale.com/curation-search-and-the-future-of-the-web):

> I think curation, actual human curation, is going to play an important role in the future. In a web filled with generated nonsense, content curated by knowledgeable human beings is going to be incredibly valuable.

I agree with Manu’s general idea, but I might disagree a bit with how it can be best executed. I have a stake in this as a co-creator of [a blogging platform](https://pika.page/). It has entered my mind that maybe these smaller blogging platforms (Pika, Micro.blog, Scribbles, Bear, etc) could pool resources to build some sort of curation system. Or maybe a third party will figure something out. All of this, though, is a call to “knowledgeable human beings,” as Manu says, to curate the web for us.

In my opinion we must look within for the solution. _We_ are the human beings that are meant to curate the web. We should continue to spread the word about how we use the web, which is very personal and as active participants. We should make clear our desire for technologies that are accessible for non-technical people to be able to join us in controlling their own web presence. We build our websites and share our thoughts and link our links. Over time the web becomes surfable to more and more people.

There will be many knowledgeable humans taking part in this mass curation. I thank them in advance for their involvement in this effort. But [don’t let your lack of deep knowledge dissuade you from sharing some thoughts](https://bjhess.com/posts/you-re-a-blogger-not-an-essayist), linking some links, and actively participating in _our_ World Wide Web.
