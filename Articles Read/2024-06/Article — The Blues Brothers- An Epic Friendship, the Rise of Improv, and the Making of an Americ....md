### The Blues Brothers: An Epic Friendship, the Rise of Improv, and the Making of an American Film Classic

## By Daniel de Visé

#####  White Rabbit 386pp £25 

The pages of my copy of _The Blues Brothers_ started to fall out as I was reading it, just as John Belushi entered the story. It was perhaps fitting, since his considerable talents were matched by a gift for self-destruction. Belushi was at the front of a wave of talented actors and comedians who announced themselves to America on _NBC’s Saturday Night_, which then became _Saturday Night Live_. The show, with its mixture of comedy and political satire, launched a number of careers, including those of Dan Aykroyd, Chevy Chase and Bill Murray.

Belushi and Aykroyd would go on to make _The Blues Brothers_, the focus of this absolute blast of a book by Daniel de Visé, full of incredible research and fascinating details. Originating in a _Saturday Night Live_ sketch, the film features Belushi and Aykroyd as ‘Joliet’ Jake and Elwood Blues, two brothers ‘on a mission from God’ to raise money to save the Catholic orphanage where they were brought up from closing. It’s a film in the great tradition of Tinseltown lunacy, one of those overblown productions that go way over schedule and budget. Acquired by Universal after a bidding war, the project had no script at the outset, just two stars and their desire to reacquaint America with some of her greatest black musicians and their work – and crash lots of cars while doing so. Hampered at every turn by bureaucracy and a wayward cast, _The Blues Brothers_ might have become ‘a cinematic Vietnam’. That it didn’t is a miracle as surprising as anything that happens in the film. 

Belushi was born in Chicago to Albanian-­American parents. A talented sportsman, he soon found his true calling – performing, singing and improvising sketches in which he mimicked figures such as Elizabeth Taylor. His physical, anarchic comedy took him via _Saturday Night Live_ to superstardom in _National Lampoon’s Animal House_,a classic campus film that spawned a generation of lesser gross-out comedies. He plays John ‘Bluto’ Blutarsky, the wildest of the Delta fraternity students, who are constantly threatened with expulsion. Despite relatively little screentime, he dominates the film in his ‘College’ sweater (I was pleased to learn it was his own and that he shot the food-fight scene in one take).

Belushi’s offscreen lifestyle was not so different from Bluto’s. Initially slow to discover alcohol and drugs, he would soon outdo everyone in his consumption of them. Fellow cast members at _Saturday Night Live_ would carry a ‘Belushi bottle’, an almost empty vial of cocaine, which they could surrender to him when asked. And the partying was everything you’d expect. When he and Aykroyd opened the Blues Bar, it drew in some of the greats of music and screen. Keith Richards and Francis Ford Coppola tended the bar on the opening night, serving a clientele that included the Grateful Dead.

One of this book’s many strengths is the portrayal of the friendship and dynamic between the two stars. De Visé points out that ‘Belushi’s fans think they know him; Aykroyd’s fans are certain they don’t.’ Aykroyd had come to Chicago from Canada, where his family had settled generations before. His great-grandfather had moonlighted as a medium. His mother wanted him to be a Catholic priest. He was diagnosed with Tourette syndrome early on (he would eventually master the tics) and sent to therapy, where he was revealed to have a very high IQ. Like Belushi, he was an incredible mimic. His love for the blues was there from a young age. On one occasion, he played drums for Muddy Waters when the singer’s drummer momentarily vanished for a cigarette break. 

It is Aykroyd who was the real driving force behind _The Blues Brothers_. He wrote the screenplay and he and the director, John Landis, enlisted some of the greatest names in rhythm and blues to appear in the film, from Aretha Franklin, James Brown, Ray Charles and Cab Calloway to John Lee Hooker. Told to behave like musicians, many of the cast did, led by Belushi, who overdosed twice during the production and had to be kept on oxygen between some takes. One shoot cost $3.5 million, more than any single scene for a film made in a major city. And 103 cars were destroyed in the making of the film, a record at the time.
