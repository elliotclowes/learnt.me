# Article text
In January 2006 the CEOs of some of the world’s largest retailers descended on the Harmonie Club, a private members’ club in Manhattan, for a meeting of the minds. They sipped from flutes of champagne and ate canapés while catching up on the chaos of the Christmas holidays.

The guest list of the annual party, thrown by the investment bank Financo, remained largely the same from year to year and included heavyweights such as the wrap- dress doyenne Diane von Furstenberg, Martha Stewart, and the CEOs of J.Crew and the American department store chains Macy’s and Saks Fifth Avenue. That year someone new was in the mix. Amid the clubby crowd of CEOs was a balding man in a dark suit. It was Jeff Bezos. 

Amazon’s market value was just $19 billion at the time. It had made its name as a bookseller and had since entered other categories including toys, CDs, movies and gadgets. But the retailers underestimated the company. Shoppers would never deign to buy their clothes from Amazon, they thought. 

David Jaffe, the former chair and CEO of Ascena Retail Group, the American women’s clothing company, recalls spotting Bezos at the bar. “What are you doing here?” he asked. Bezos’s answer made him raise his eyebrows. 

“Your margin is my opportunity,” the CEO responded. (An Amazon spokesman denied that Bezos, who now serves as Amazon’s executive chairman, said this.)

“People were intrigued by Amazon, but I don’t think they totally bought into it,” says Gilbert Harrison, the founder of Financo, who threw the event.

That would change. Weeks after the party, Amazon announced a deal to buy the luxury clothing website Shopbop. It would soon move more aggressively into stealing market share in the clothing sector.

The guest list of attendees that year now reads like a bankruptcy note. The CEOs of US department stores such as Filene’s Basement and Neiman Marcus were in attendance, listening to an unassuming tech CEO speak effusively about retail. They had no idea the guy with the goofy laugh would soon be eating their lunch.

==Amazon.com was launched in 1995 as an online bookstore during the start of the internet frenzy. Its revolutionary business model at a time when shopping centres and department stores reigned supreme allowed it to grow for years without showing profits — an extraordinarily long leash from shareholders who demanded quarterly profits from its retail competitors. That free pass from Wall Street — coupled with a loophole permitting mail-order catalogues to forgo collecting sales taxes in states where they didn’t have physical locations — meant Amazon could grow unfettered, taking market share from rivals along the way.== 

Even early on Amazon’s most senior team of leaders talked about its “total addressable market” (finance-speak for a company’s top revenue potential) as “everybody else’s operating margin”, recalls Warren Jenson, Amazon’s CFO until 2002\. Put another way, if your company made money, Amazon viewed you as the competition and was coming for your business. While this was ambitious, Amazon would make good on that.

It was never just about the books. It wasn’t even just about retail. In meetings with senior leaders Bezos would describe a world where customers didn’t just visit Amazon.com once a month for various items such as paper towels and batteries. Instead Amazon would become embedded in the customers’ lifestyle. 

Bezos came to call this the “daily habit”, which would make Amazon an essential part of people’s lives in both implicit and explicit ways. The company dissected habits that people formed, such as watching videos or listening to music, and decided that whatever those categories were, Amazon needed to be in them.

“Jeff was talking about making Amazon a ‘daily habit’ at a bunch of meetings,” recalls Roy Price, who headed up Amazon Studios until October 2017\. “When you think about music and video, that puts you in touch with the brand on a daily basis, so if you want to increase the frequency of touchpoints, \[you\] transform the brand from some place I occasionally go to get a book to something I am in touch with every day,” Price says. “The change for Amazon was moving from a retailer you went to when you needed to buy something to a service provider who was part of your lifestyle.” 

Just as Amazon had fully disrupted retail, it would now methodically spread its tentacles into other industries with a focus on integrating itself into everyday life.

The result is a monolithic company with no modern comparable. Amazon now ranks as a market leader in several industries beyond retail, from logistics and cloud computing to smart devices. Wall Street has made vocal bets on Amazon’s ability to disrupt ever new sectors. The day Amazon acquired Whole Foods in 2017, nearly $22 billion of American grocery chains’ market value was erased.

As it continued entering other industries, watching Amazon decimate rivals became a pastime on Wall Street, with one firm even keeping a “Death by Amazon” index. Its astonishing range of commercial activities has put it head to head with juggernauts such as FedEx, Google, Netflix, Microsoft, Apple and Walmart. While the clothing CEOs might have been dismissive back in 2006, Amazon is now the most feared and talked about company in boardrooms around the world, across all industries. 

Part of Amazon’s success — but also its more problematic behaviour — is driven by a cut-throat culture where employees are incentivised to win at all costs. The company uses stack ranking, grading employees against each other on a curve and cutting the bottom 6 per cent each year. Compensation is backloaded for new employees, with the majority of restricted stock units paid in years three and four. Amazon’s spokesman disputed that it does stack ranking. But internal documents, my interviews with senior executives and public reporting show years of Amazon’s use of the practice.

In its early years Bezos is said to have expressed frustration that staff didn’t share his “killer instinct”. Employees have said the company would hire people who reflected Bezos’s drive to dominate and dictate how Amazon behaved. Amazon denies that Bezos ever expressed this. 

An environment where every year employees are fired from an already all-star pool of Ivy League talent, at a company with unprecedented access to data, meant that accessing such data to gain an edge was an unspoken incentive to stay ahead.

In 2015 Amazon was developing a new private-label food brand, Wickedly Prime. A paper the team wrote to get approval from senior leaders stated that Wickedly Prime aimed to replicate the top 200 items sold at Trader Joe’s, an American grocery store chain with a loyal following.

The problem was Trader Joe’s secrets were well guarded. The grocer doesn’t offer online shopping, so less is known about its top sellers than those of other brands that sell online and have reviews. Trader Joe’s makes much of its food itself, with interesting concoctions that fly off the shelves, such as cinnamon bun spread. It was hard for Amazon to figure out which 200 items to copy because of this secretiveness, but it was determined to find out.

Trader Joe’s grocery store, the inspiration for Amazon’s Wickedly Prime

To help in its quest, Amazon recruited an employee from Trader Joe’s. She wasn’t told specifically what she’d be working on. During her first week she walked into a conference room at headquarters that had brown paper covering the windows and door to ensure privacy, and she started piecing things together. The room was filled with boxes of Trader Joe’s food piled high on shelves. Amazon had bought up the grocer’s products — mostly snacks — to study for its own brand. It alarmed the employee, who was hired to help create product assortment for Wickedly Prime.

For six months the employee’s manager hounded her for information about Trader Joe’s bestselling products. She tried to deflect but the pressure kept ratcheting up. Finally the manager demanded that the employee email any documents she had kept from her time at Trader Joe’s to another colleague on the team. She emailed over an Excel spreadsheet that detailed Trader Joe’s top-selling items nationally over the course of a week. It contained the number of units sold per item.

But her manager didn’t stop. He also insisted that she share Trader Joe’s margins for each product. When she refused, her manager screamed at her, “You just have to give us the data!” a person who witnessed the exchange said. The employee burst into tears but declined to share the margins data.

Nonetheless, the team disseminated her sales document and started to think about how to use it. Another employee became uncomfortable with the ethics of using Trader Joe’s proprietary data and reported it to legal. Soon the handful of employees who had accessed the data were fired. Amazon responded to the behaviour appropriately, but employees on the team say that the use of the data was emblematic of the type of pressure they were under.

“We do not condone the misuse of proprietary confidential information, and thoroughly investigate any reports of employees doing so and take action, which may include termination,” Amazon said in response.

Anna Dreda, who bought a bookstore in Much Wenlock, Shropshire, in 2003, had stocked her shop with bestsellers, children’s books, poetry and whatever else she felt her customers would like. She threw a poetry festival and other community events. She lived on only £1,500 a month, all made through the proceeds from sales, but it was worth it. “I was never going to make a lot of money. It was a labour of love,” she says. 

But in subsequent years she had to reduce her monthly salary. First she lowered it to just £1,000, then to £750\. Customer habits were starting to change, with many people coming into the shop and browsing the shelves, only to take photos of the books that interested them but leaving empty-handed. Dreda knew they were buying them on Amazon, whose prices she couldn’t beat. “Amazon was selling books for just the cost of postage,” she says. Some would come to the register with a book and ask if she could match Amazon’s price. It was impossible. 

She held on for a few years without taking any pay, with her partner supporting her, but eventually in early May 2019 she made the difficult decision to close the store she had owned since 2003\. She describes that period as a “month-long surgery without anaesthetic”. ==Since 1995 the number of independent bookshop owners in the UK has dwindled from 1,894 to 1,072 (although there has been a resurgence in recent years), according to the Booksellers Association.==

Ahead of the closure customers came into the shop in tears. “People had so many memories attached to the bookstore and they realised what they were losing,” Dreda says, adding that you can buy a book on Amazon but that the retailer would never be able to replicate the experiences a local bookshop and bookseller provide.

The linchpin of Amazon’s retail success is its army of third-party sellers from around the world who create unlimited selection on Amazon.com. In recent years, as criticism of Amazon causing the closing of shops on the high street, decimating shopping centres, hurting competition and exploiting warehouse workers has mounted, the company has tried to rebrand itself as a benefactor of these small businesses that sell on its website, touting the jobs it helps create at these companies. But behind the scenes Amazon’s own sellers live in fear. 

Remarkably, of all items sold online in the US, about 40 per cent are sold by Amazon. That market share means that sellers feel that they need to be on the platform in order to succeed, a dynamic that gives Amazon all the leverage. Selling on Amazon.com comes with various fees, from a percentage of each sale to other “optional” services such as participating in its Fulfilment by Amazon programme — which includes storage and shipping — or advertising on the site. Sellers say that signing up to both are required to be successful on the platform, which has hurt their margins. To offset these fees many recount raising their prices for customers. 

Amazon’s dominance means it benefits from each step. Selling an item? Amazon collects a fee. Shipping the item through Amazon’s logistics? Amazon collects a fee. Buying advertising from Amazon? Amazon collects a fee. While the company profited handsomely from this dynamic, seller profits have been squeezed. For the better part of Amazon’s history it was able to grow unscrutinised. But in recent years regulators and politicians have examined Amazon’s effects on competition and its power over its third-party sellers. 

Efforts to question its business practices gathered steam in Europe well before they did in the US. In September 2018 EU antitrust authorities opened up a preliminary investigation into how Amazon treated third-party sellers in Europe. 

In 2022 Britain’s competition watchdog, the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA), opened up an investigation into whether Amazon was abusing its power and “whether Amazon is using third-party data to give an unfair boost to its own retail business and whether it favours sellers who use its logistics and delivery services — both of which could weaken competition,” the regulator said. Amazon offered to make changes to its UK Marketplace to address the concerns, which the CMA accepted.

“Amazon likes to refer to the third-party sellers as ‘partners’, but that is not at all what third-party sellers experience selling on Amazon,” said the former US Congressman David Cicilline, who chaired the antitrust subcommittee that investigated Amazon and other tech companies. “These third-party sellers live in fear of Amazon. They recognise that it could just change an algorithm or kick them off Amazon, and they have no recourse and they would be out of business. That’s the kind of economic terror that they generated.” 

On September 26, 2023, the Federal Trade Commission sued Amazon for being an illegal monopoly in the biggest challenge to Amazon’s supremacy in its nearly 30-year history. “Amazon now takes one of every two dollars that a seller makes, so sellers are effectively paying a 50 per cent Amazon tax that has steadily been increasing over the past decade. And prices are higher for shoppers as a result,” the FTC chairwoman Lina Khan said of the lawsuit. The agency made the case that Amazon’s dominance in ecommerce is so strong that the giant causes prices to rise not just on Amazon.com but at other retailers as well. 

“The company fundamentally disagrees with the FTC’s allegations because they are wrong or misleading, and they would harm consumers and independent businesses,” Amazon says. It also says it has innovated for customers, spurred lower prices, enabled millions of successful small businesses and significantly increased competition in retail.

SPLASH

Antitrust lawsuits do not move quickly. It will probably take years for us to know the verdict. Regardless of the outcome, it’s worth wondering if the damage has already been done. Amazon’s dominance has not lessened despite numerous regulatory investigations into the company’s business practices. It has only gained more power, forging ahead into more industries.

And its power continues to grow. Consider how difficult it would be to avoid Amazon for a week if you tried. If you stream on Netflix you are within its ecosystem since the company uses Amazon Web Services. If you buy a Peloton bike there’s a good chance Amazon will deliver it. Watching a James Bond film? Amazon now owns MGM, which has a gigantic film catalogue, including the Bond films. Amazon has indeed become the daily habit that its founder envisioned.

These days Jeff Bezos seems to spend more time on his $500 million megayacht with his fiancée, Lauren Sánchez, than on Amazon’s day-to-day operations. He even announced that he is permanently leaving Seattle — a city synonymous with Amazon — to relocate to Miami. In February he sold shares in Amazon worth $8.5 billion. Even so, the culture Bezos created persists. The drive to win and survive trumps all else. 

Where we go from here is anyone’s guess, but it’s impossible to ignore what Amazon has achieved in industry after industry, and what that means for the rest of us. Even if the FTC wins its case and breaks Amazon up, the pieces themselves are market leaders in their own right. And that’s assuming the FTC manages to break it up. While it’s impossible to forecast the future, the impact of Amazon on our daily life — and on this century — has already been substantial.
