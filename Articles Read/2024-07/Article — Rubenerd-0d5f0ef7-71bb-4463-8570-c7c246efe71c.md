## [Decision making is social behaviour](https://rubenerd.com/decision-making-is-social-behaviour/)

American psychologist Lee Roy Beach, [as quoted in WikiQuote](https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Lee%5FRoy%5FBeach#The%5FPsychology%5Fof%5FDecision%5FMaking:%5FPeople%5Fin%5FOrganizations,%5F2005):

> Decision making is essentially social behaviour, even when there is nobody else present, because one anticipates how others will react and factors this into the decision. \[â€¦\] Organizations per se do not make decisions, but individuals in organizations do. And when they do, they must take others into account.
