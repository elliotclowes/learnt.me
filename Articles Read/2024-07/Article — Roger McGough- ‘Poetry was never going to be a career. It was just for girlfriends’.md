# Article text
The closest poetry has come to cool was probably in 1967\. At the start of the Summer of Love, Penguin published a slim volume by three young Liverpudlians with a blocky black-and-orange design that looked more like a vinyl sleeve than a book jacket. It was called _The Mersey Sound_. A few weeks later another kind of Mersey sound, _Sgt Pepper’s Lonely Hearts Club Band_, hit the record shops and “for a brief while”, as one possibly overheated Rolling Stone magazine writer put it, “the irreparable fragmented consciousness of the West was unified, at least in the minds of the young”.

Everyone was getting high on the sound of Liverpool (and potentially a few other substances) — the city’s music, but also its lyrics. Penguin printed 20,000 copies of _Mersey Sound_, expecting it to last bookshops a decade, but it sold out in three months, anointing poetry’s Fab Three, Roger McGough, Brian Patten and Adrian Henri. Of the trio it was McGough who became a durable star. For five decades his buoyant but wry verse — now collected in 700 friendly pages — has sold in unpoetically large quantities. And as the host of _Poetry Please_, the much-loved Radio 4 programme on which actors perform listener requests, he has become the nation’s smooth Scouse highway to classic poetry.

McGough, 86, is a spry, snow-haired hippy with a single gold hoop earring, a soft, familiar voice and a sharp sense of humour (“Is there anything else we should talk about?” I ask as we’re wrapping up. “My charisma?” he suggests). We meet at the Olympic Studios, in Barnes, south London, near where he lives. It was here, in the Sixties, that he would record (“and get wrecked”) with his band the Scaffold, who had a UK No 1 in 1968 with _Lily the Pink_. Afterwards in the green room they would bump into Elton John, the Rolling Stones and of course, the Beatles.

The Fab Four were practically family. “They were cool even then,” he says remembering them before they were famous. “I was a teacher and they would be just back from Hamburg with these long leather coats.” One of McGough’s bandmates, Mike, was Macca’s younger brother, while Thelma Monaghan, whom he married in 1970, had been to school with John and briefly dated Paul. They all belonged to the same effervescent Liverpool art scene; Paul and George used to turn up to McGough’s late-night poetry readings in clubs. “The same people would come, the same students. They would listen to rock’n’roll and then the poetry; they didn’t differentiate.” This was a time and a place where the line between pop and poetry, which today feels more like a brick wall, dissolved into the salty night air.

Why did the Sixties produce such a superabundance of talent — and why Liverpool, that “starstruck, eternal romantic … gateway to the Atlantic”, as one of McGough’s poems has it? “There was just physical access to the records,” McGough says. “So much came in on ships from America. And people in Liverpool have a good attitude, they aren’t sniffy. They’ll get involved.”

Speaking of sniffy, the literary establishment wasn’t terribly impressed by the Mersey poets. The trio were “totally omitted” from the influential 1982 _Penguin Book of Contemporary British Poetry_, “just removed from the canon”. A smile. “Not that I feel bitter about it.” How much of that snubbing, does he think, was about class and geography? “A lot, I’m afraid. I don’t want to bang on about it, but I do think so.” I’m struck by his reluctance to complain — his is not a generation that peddles its traumas as enthusiastically as mine.

McGough was born into a working-class Irish Catholic family in Merseyside in 1937\. His father, a docker, avoided school functions, embarrassed by “other fathers who were cleverer than him or better dressed”, and was always a little mystified by his dreamy son. He died when McGough was 18, “before I did anything”, and inspired some of his loveliest poems. What would he have made of his son’s success? “Puzzled, obviously puzzled. I don’t know whether he would have read the poems. But dead proud.”

At school, in elocution lessons to rid the kids of their Scouse accents, McGough recited poetry. “I wish it were brought back. Standing in front of the rest of the class reading ‘Half a league, half a league’ and _Jabberwocky_. I enjoyed that.” Uninspired by the rest of the English teaching, he failed his literature O-level (“I didn’t read the books”) and in 1954 went to study French and geography at the University of Hull, where Philip Larkin was librarian.

It was there, inspired by an album recording of Dylan Thomas’s _Under Milk Wood_ and a visit from the scruffy-haired pacifist poet Christopher Logue (“He was writing about politics, the war in Cyprus, and smoking cigs. Gauloises”) that McGough ventured into verse. “It was never going to be a career; I just enjoyed it. It was for me. And for girlfriends.”

In some ways, he thinks he benefited from his sideways route into poetry. “I’ve talked to many people over the years who went to Oxford and Cambridge and did English and wanted to write, but were actually afraid to. It wasn’t until maybe 20 years later that they felt free of any sort of comparison \[to the canon\]. I never had that.”

Today, however, many would see him as a squarely establishment figure, thanks in part to his three-decades-long tenure presenting _Poetry Please_, which he still loves doing. “It’s been a good journey. Interesting the way it’s changed. At one time it was mainly women listeners of a certain age, in the south. Now, by bringing in younger poets \[as guests\] particularly, the audience is expanding. Diversity and things, it’s been good. But doing that, you’re losing some \[listeners\] as well.” He mimics a disgruntled older fan: “What happened to _If_? Where’s Robert Frost?”

Younger listeners tend to fish the show out of an app, but for years it was broadcast on Radio 4 on a Saturday night. At book signings, McGough says, there was always at least one older woman who would come up to him and say (he puts on a squeaky voice): “Roger, I go to bed with you every Saturday night. And I always fall asleep before you finish!”

Times have changed and McGough is happy to change with them — mostly. Going back through his archives to assemble _Collected Poems_, he occasionally came across a line that jarred. “Gosh, did I say this? Uh oh.” In the foreword, he cheerfully informs the reader that he’s revised some of the originals. “There is a sense, not so much among poets themselves, but among academics, that poems are sacred texts and, once completed, should remain forever thus. I disagree. Attitudes change over the years, mine as well as society’s.”

Some poems he left out entirely; for instance, _The Jogger’s Song_ from 1984, a grimly powerful poem based on a real crime, which imagines the self-justifications of a park runner who, appealed to for help by a woman who had just been raped, decided instead to rape her himself. “Well, she was asking for it./ Lyin there, cryin out,/ Dyin for it. Pissed of course.”

McGough stands by the work. “It was quite a powerful poem, I felt. But when it came out back then I got in a lot of trouble. People said, you, Roger McGough, are promoting \[rape culture\]. I said, it’s not me. I’m not saying this.” So this time he left it out. “Can’t be arsed with that.” For anyone disappointed by the sanitation: “The originals are available in good second-hand bookshops.”

He worries about kids today, about screentime eroding reading. “You can’t curl up with a f\*\*\*ing phone, can you?” Still, “I’m always hopeful, don’t know why.”

Just back from Mallorca (“brown as a cauliflower”), he’s straight off to Genoa for a literary festival, and then to read his poems at Glastonbury. Not bad for 86\. In verse, he sometimes imagines his own ending: “I don’t want any of that/ ‘We’re gathered here today/ to celebrate his life, not to mourn his passing.’/ Oh yes you are.” How much does he think about death? He pauses, chews this over. “It doesn’t overpower me.”

### I am Not Sleeping

_by Roger McGough_

I don’t want any of that  
‘We’re gathered here today  
to celebrate his life, not mourn his passing.’  
Oh yes you are. Get one thing straight,  
you’re not here to celebrate  
but to mourn until it hurts.

I want wailing and gnashing of teeth.  
I want sobs, and I want them  
Uncontrollable. I want women  
flinging themselves on the coffin  
and I want them inconsolable.

Don’t dwell on my past but on your future.  
For what you see is what you’ll be  
and sooner than you think.  
So get weeping. Fill yourselves with dread.  
For I am not sleeping. I am dead.
