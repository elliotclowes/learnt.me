###### Alexander Calder’s workshop

Something I found frustrating when learning how to write was that writing advice tends to be _very_ low resolution. You have someone looking back on their experience writing for decades and they sum it up by saying, oh, well, don’t use adverbs.

I wish there were more detailed accounts of the decisions writers make when they struggle with a particular piece.

And since my general rule of thumb when writing this Substack is “write stuff that I would have loved to read a year ago”, I figured I should do that. A case study of how I write an essay. I’ll do _[Looking for Alice](https://www.henrikkarlsson.xyz/p/looking-for-alice)_, an essay about not dating, one of the better I’ve written.

I warn you: this is going to be over-the-top nerdery. It is not for normal human beings. But if you like writing, or enjoy seeing someone analyze their craft, maybe this will be fun and useful.

==I wrote== _==Looking for Alice==_ ==at what for me is a rapid pace—I had the idea on the evening of the 28th of December, 2022, and published it on January 17th, 2023. Normally, it takes me several months of revisions before a piece comes together.==

This is where the idea came from.

I was on a Zoom call with Steve Krouse, an internet friend who lives in Brooklyn and runs a startup called [val.town](https://www.val.town/). We were having a normal internet friend conversation about Seymour Papert and end-user programming and such stuff, when Steve said, “This might be a strange question, but I wonder if you have any thoughts about dating.” He was under the impression that I am happily married (correct) and wanted to know how I did that.

There is a classic writing tip that says you should imagine the person you are writing for—it is even better when that person is asking you questions. As Steve asked questions, I noticed it was a lot of fun telling him about the experiences I had when I met my wife, Johanna. And it seemed he liked the advice I gave.

Maybe I should write it down? I thought.

No, that would be ridiculous—a piece about _love_.

But maybe?

Substack saves a version history of every post. Looking at the time stamps, it seems like I made a draft right after the call. Then for the next four hours, I opened it several times to jut down ideas in case I wanted to write the piece, which I surely shouldn’t do.

I remember that I was working on a long series of posts (still not finished) about designing software to facilitate social learning, which felt like an IMPORTANT topic. But the important stuff was a slog, so I kept procrastinating by sketching up ideas for the piece about not dating.

It should have been obvious that this was a good piece. When something forces you to write even though you can’t justify it and even feel a little ashamed, it must have some inherent energy to be able to push past your defenses. Pieces you don’t feel awkward about (when you have an idea and go, “Ah, this is great, people will like this!”)—those ideas don’t need to be as good to get themselves written. My resistance is a filter, and the ideas that pass through it are my best pieces.

By midnight (when I really should have been asleep for several hours), the draft looked like this footnote[1](https://www.henrikkarlsson.xyz/p/how-i-wrote-looking-for-alice#footnote-1-121184083). It is not good—”The first draft of anything is shit”, as Hemingway had it—but if you’ve read the essay you recognize that a few of the things that made it into the finished piece have already appeared on the first night.

The evening after, I again felt drawn to the idea and ended up collecting notes and sketching for four hours. At this stage, I still had no intention to write the essay—it’s just that ideas kept popping into my mind, and I wrote them down.

I searched my email since I have had a decade-plus-long conversation with my ex, P, and we’ve talked a lot about dating, so maybe there is something there I could use? I emailed her asking if there was anything I had said that had been particularly not-stupid.

Looking over the material this haphazard notetaking surfaced, I realized I was looking at a listicle: 5 things to do if you want to find a good match. And listicles are good, readers like that, and having every part of a piece answer the same question gives it a strong coherence.

But.

Also.

Lists are tacky.

So I figured I should embellish the list—turn it into something that wasn’t obviously as a list. _I could turn it into a story._ If I sorted the advice in the order it was relevant in the story of how I met Johanna then I could string a few biographical details through the list, and it would feel like a narrative—_while the fact that it was also a list would give it a deeper coherence and pull._ I shuffled the ideas around a bit and wrote down stories and details from my life that I figured could craft a sort of narrative.

I liked the energy of having a narrative overlay a list. But still: I wasn’t going to write it.

I figured it should be a bit of an obstacle course in the middle, to give it a narrative pulse, so I put the part where it’s not working in the middle, and I made a mental note to make that part longer than necessary from a strictly intellectual point of view so that the story would have an arc.

Everything just came together of itself, against my will. I usually find it hard to figure out the right way to organize the ideas I want to cover in a sequence that makes sense to the reader.

Now I had a structure that looked like this—a series of ideas, all answering the same question, and a narrative flowing through all of it.

> Some intro hook—what?
> 
> **learn to pattern match** (about before we met, and the first time we met, and the gertrude stein anecdote)
> 
> **Don’t let go if you find someone cool** (get to the point where she doesn’t want to hang out, and then lean into those 18 months as a vehicle to talk about the ideas)
> 
> **Speedrun authentic** (first I was in her apartment and talked like an idiot, maybe I can fit in the Herzog story here??)
> 
> **Don’t talk to other people about your dating life** (\[redacted\])
> 
> Outro

I made these points into titles in the document and sorted the notes I had written under the appropriate titles while adding new notes about what I wanted to do in each part. Anything that came to mind: maybe a part about Bayaki pygmies singing? an analysis of Pierre’s engagement in _War and Peace?_ a commentary on Bachtin’s comment on Dostoevsky?

About two hours into that session, I had a great insight. I realized that the underlying idea in all the advice was that you should be open-minded about what a relationship is and not assume too much, _and that anecdote about Gertrude Stein saying that she isn’t lesbian encapsulates that!_ I moved it to the opening line, as a hook:

Someone once asked Gertrude Stein if she was a lesbian. Stein answered no, _I just like Alice._ 

That felt like a bold opening. Could I write like that? I wasn’t sure. But I liked the energy.

==It felt like a concept handle, yes,== _==a concept handle==_==. That is== ==[a Scott Alexander phrase](https://slatestarcodex.com/2016/02/20/writing-advice/)====: a concept handle is a memorable phrase that makes it easy to remember an idea, like a handle that makes the concept easy to grasp.== I should lean into the concept-handle-yness of the Gertrude Stein anecdote, I thought. Maybe the piece should be called something something Alice?

I played around with that idea. Maybe _an Alice_ could be the concept handle for the idea that I was trying to communicate? “You are not looking for a girlfriend or a boyfriend, you are looking for an Alice.” Yes, that _is_ good: it will make it easy to remember the way I frame the ideas. “Looking for Alice: that’s what you should do. Not dating.”

In fact, let’s make that the title. _Looking for Alice._ And in case that is too poetic for people, let’s make the subtitle _Not dating._

I could now, after 8 hours of unintentionally poking at the idea, see what the piece wanted to be. I had a progression of ideas, I had a narrative pull, and I had a framing device that brought it together. From that point on, I just needed to type it out.

Even better, I had already written most of it. When I tidied up the notes, I noticed that I had good material for all parts except the last two.

Before moving on, let me make a general comment about outlining.

==Many of my favorite writers—Knausgaard, Kapuschinski, Dawkins, Sebald—do not outline (like I do; not in the piece you are reading right now, though). And the reason for this is that writing from an outline tends to produce dead writing. Good writing needs to be a happening, as Kapuschinski says.==

==When you have a set of bullet points you want to cover and a lot of notes, it is common that the piece either gets stiff and list-like, or that it feels like a messy collage that doesn’t form a coherent whole. To avoid that, I don’t pay too much attention to the outline and the notes when I draft the actual piece. It is just a scaffolding that keeps me focused. When I get lost, I can peek at it to see where I’m supposed to be going.== _==But I let the logic of the sentences, the rhythm, decide what needs to happen next==_==. I will often drop a few bullet points and only use half of the sketches I've made because they don't fit with the flow of the piece.==

==Everything must be subservient to the form, as Knausgaard says. When a writer is so eager to say something that she says it at the expense of the structural logic of the piece—the writing loses energy.==

==Since I am one of those poor souls who can’t write without an outline, this is a bit of a headache.==

==I have to redo the “write-through” several times. That is: I have to start at the top and write it again several times (though often reusing parts from earlier attempts). I make a draft and then, alas, I discover that I need to cover points I didn’t think of when outlining, or I need to rearrange parts. I write notes about what needs to change in the document, fast sketches of new paragraphs, and move things around. But then, once I’m happy with the new structure, I'll start from the top and write through it again in a new document.==

Bertrand Russell was even more radical: if he discovered that the piece needed to change—even just a paragraph—he threw it all away. Being a bit lazy, I keep the old draft open in another tab in my browser and try to salvage as much as possible, often pasting in entire parts. _But only when it fits into the logic of how the piece now flows._ Many parts will need to be rewritten to stay true to the new rhythm. This is ok. Recreating a paragraph is usually easy since I’ve already written it and so have it “in my body”.

Sometimes I’m lucky and it is just a transition that is failing. I have two good parts, but moving from one to the other feels off. When I was younger, I would try to solve this by adding a short paragraph that bridges the gap and connects the parts. That was hard. What works better for me, is to cut a few lines at the end of the first part and the start of the second part and rewrite that, too. It is like when a piece of the woodwork on your house has rotted: you remove it, and a few inches on both sides and replace it with fresh wood.

To change metaphors: when you are writing, it’s like water skiing. When the flow breaks somewhere (in a transition, or elsewhere), it’s like you are moving too slowly to stay on the surface. By starting a paragraph or two before the transition, I can approach the thing that needs to be fixed with more velocity—I will literally try to type as fast as I can—hoping that I can gain enough momentum for the water to hold across to the other side of the transition.

If you are precious about your words (“Oh, no, I can’t trash this paragraph that took me two hours to write!”), you will not get high enough velocity. And so the piece will not flow as a whole. So be careless. Throw all of those carefully crafted sentences away and write new ones. Write fast.

This is the night when the piece comes together.

Let’s look at the evolution of a single paragraph. On the first night, at 11:28 pm, I had written this rather cryptic line about the end of the 18-month-long period when Johanna did not feel like dating me:

> Eventually, she had worked through what she needed to work through.

I made a few other notes in other parts of the document, and then two minutes later I felt the urge to be more concrete, so I returned and added a few lines about the place we were at when the plot point occurred:

> Eventually, she worked through what she needed to work through. **Walking home one night along the same path, we came to the river. I lived on one side. She lived on the other. “Where are we going?” I said, trying to sound as much as possible as if I was talking about geography. She nodded with her head to her block.**

I seem to have spent about 3 minutes writing this, so I had some feeling this might be useful—I wasn’t typing as fast as I could. But I wasn’t polishing it obsessively either: I try very hard not to do that at this stage, I want to be careless. If I feel uncertain about something, I delete it immediately. I can recreate it if I discover that it shouldn’t have been deleted. If I start fiddling with the words, I get blocked—so fast fast fast, and if in doubt: delete.

==(About five times in two years have I had to use version history to restore something that I deleted. Almost always I discover when I look at something that I am contemplating restoring that it wasn’t any good. I can do it better if I write it again, wildly.)==

Nothing happens with the scene at the river for another day. Then, on the second day, I add a reference to Kurt Vonnegut.

> Eventually, she worked through what she needed to work through. Walking home one night along the same path, we came to the river. I lived on one side. She lived on the other. “Where are we going?” I said, trying to sound as much as possible as if I was talking about geography. She nodded with her head to her block. **And so it goes.**

This is the line Vonnegut adds every time someone dies in _Slaughterhouse Five_. Here, it is a reference to the fact that I was already in a relationship when I met my wife, and that relationship, yes, it died that night. So it goes.

==I add a lot of overwrought inside jokes like that. They amuse me. Usually, I take them out again when I edit. Having a few of them gives the text a certain depth and tone—the ghostly presence of other voices—but too much becomes glitter. There is a story about Woody Allen: the first time he wrote for== _==The New Yorker==_==, the editor told him, “Your jokes, they’re all hilarious, but you need to cut half of them so the other ones can shine.” And this is how it is with anything too smart or too fun. Use it in small doses for the best effect.==

On the third night, I return to the passage about the river again, making a few short edits as I’m skimming through. I’m not sure if the edits I made were stuff I noticed on the fly, or if they were things that had bugged me during the day—that often happens. I get a bad feeling in my body when I think about a line I wrote the night before, and I start editing it in my head to make the feeling go away. There are hundreds of notes all over the house where I have written down these edits. I never read the notes. I write them to make the line stop singing in my head.

This time the edits I needed to make were these:

> Walking home one night **in April 2013**, **me and Johanna happened to be walking along the same path.** We came to **the F.** river. I lived on one side. Johanna lived on the other. “Where are we going?” I said, trying to sound as much as possible as if I was talking about geography. She nodded with her head to her block.
> 
> And **– as far as my relationship was concerned –** so it goes.

I’ve done three things:

1. I’ve removed the cryptic remark at the opening of the paragraph (“Eventually, she worked through what she needed to work through.”): that was more a note to myself after all. Also, I didn’t want to focus on Johanna’s side of the story, which that line did. I don’t have the moral right to use other people’s stories however I want to—I find writers who are careless with others reprehensible—so I put a lot of thought into what I leave in and what I take out whenever I write about others.
2. ==I’ve made the room more concrete. I’ve added a date. That always feels good to me. A date can make any sentence better.== And I’ve added that the river is named F. This is a very Kafka way of writing out names, and the reason I do it like that is that I don’t want to correlate my online writing too strongly with my offline identity. Well, why didn’t I just write “the river” then? Because that sounds too epic, the singular River; whereas “the F. river” sounds a bit cryptic, but more down to earth and real.
3. In the last line, where I paraphrase Vonnegut, I have added an explanation so it becomes less of an inside joke, and more just a weird turn of phrase: “And **–** as far as my relationship was concerned **–** so it goes.”

Now the paragraph was almost done. Looking over it a final time, I added a line break, an adjective to make the mood of Johanna’s nod more clear, and some italics. Italics used in strange places always make a piece sing. This is the final result:

> Walking home one night in April 2013, we happened to be walking along the same path. We came to the F. river. I lived on one side. Johanna lived on the other.
> 
> “Where are we going?” I said, trying to sound as much as possible as if I was talking about geography.
> 
> She nodded **slyly** with her head toward her block.
> 
> And—as far as my other relationship was concerned—_so it goes._

It is now 7:24 pm on the evening of December 30th. I have a first draft where most parts are approaching this level.

I have now spent almost 12 hours writing an essay I have no intention of publishing. I send it to Steve:

It makes me happy he appreciated the gift. But I also know that it is illegal to not complement a Christmas gift you get from a friend, especially if it is an essay they have spent 12 hours writing—so it doesn’t make me any more inclined to publish it.

The year ends.

Steve writes again:

Wait a minute! He liked it enough to share it with a friend, and the friend liked it enough to share it, too? Did I just have a draft leak? Maybe I _should_ publish it.

[![](https://proxy-prod.omnivore-image-cache.app/756x378,sNUvOQA19KS0jma2f2OFL36p605-oNrxuIPbdxl_Qsa4/https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F15877322-8cd8-4486-b348-377f365b40db_756x378.png)](https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f%5Fauto,q%5Fauto:good,fl%5Fprogressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F15877322-8cd8-4486-b348-377f365b40db%5F756x378.png)

Over the next two weeks, I dip in for a few minutes here and there to add an idea or edit a line that has bugged me while doing the dishes. (I do a lot of my writing in my head, as you notice. Perhaps everyone does this. Perhaps it is a leftover from starting my career as a spoken word poet. In my early twenties, I would often write a full thirty-minute set all in my head: I felt paper was for weaklings.)

==I feel pretty certain the essay is ready now. It has had time to settle. But since I’ve done a lot of small edits, I know I need to do a full read-through to make sure that the music works throughout. Sometimes when you edit on a sentence level, you mess up the overall rhythm.==

==When I do the read-through, I either print the essay or email it to myself. This is to make sure that I do not edit while I read. Instead, I note all the changes I want to do by hand. If I were to make the changes directly in the text, my head would get caught up in writer mode and I would start reacting to the possibilities that open up when the text changes—I’d be lost on a tangent in no time, making up new metaphors or scenes. I can’t do that while editing.==

Most of the edits are of the kind I demonstrated above. But I also do this thing where I put brackets around words or phrases that are \[lame\]. Then, when I open the document and do the edits, I improvise in the lame places, to see if I can do something more interesting. “Maybe \[lame\] should be _sounds like ChatGPT?”_ 

==Correcting a handful of boring phrases can make a big difference to the feeling of the entire piece. An essay is like a piece of music: what you say in one paragraph echoes in the next. If you are going to write a dry technical part, and there is no way to make it fun, you can== _==add a joke right before it==_==, and the reader will have the feeling of the joke with them as they read the boring part, and it will feel, if not fun, so at least funnier.==

Or if a piece is too contemporary, adding a single Roman fable can make it feel much richer. The tones sing together making a subtle harmony.

Here is a sentence I underlined as lame:

I could tell what I liked and what made me miserable.

Treat it as an exercise if you want to and see if you can make the line come alive. Think of yourself as the opposite of a large language model (like ChatGPT). A language model basically analyzes a string of words and completes it by predicting how the text would have continued if it was a sentence on the internet. Your job, on the other hand, is to write the least predictable thing that still makes sense. The further afield you go, the more rewarding it is if you get it to work.

I was also displeased with this line:

Now, on this particular night, I didn’t talk this retardedly with deliberation.

It had a nice rhythm (“retardedly”, “deliberation”), but I felt like “retardedly” was a word that some people would find offensive in a way that would distract from the scene. So see if you can find a good rewrite.

Here is ChatGPT’s attempt, so you know what to avoid:

Now, on this particular night, I didn’t intentionally speak in such a foolish manner.

In this footnote[2](https://www.henrikkarlsson.xyz/p/how-i-wrote-looking-for-alice#footnote-2-121184083), you can find my edits.

When I hit publish, I was insanely nervous. This was unlike anything I had ever published. I journaled for thirty minutes to get the stress out of my system. Then I checked Twitter—and it seemed like people liked it in a way they had never liked anything I’d done before.

Now, what can we learn from that.

Since this piece is now more than 5k words long, I’m going to wrap it here. It turns out, unsurprisingly, that trying to detail a 15-hour-long writing project is impossible! If you have a question that you wish I would have covered, leave it in the comments and I’ll continue there.

My friends are always asking me for dating advice; they never act on what I tell them.

The reason they ask me is twofold. First, I’ve managed to live a pretty weird life _–_ as weird as any life becomes if you optimize ruthlessly for staying on your path of maximum interestingness. Second, I’ve done this without sacrificing intimate relationships (that is simplifying the optimization problem by dropping a constraint). Instead, I’ve done it by chaining myself to someone who grew weird in ways synergistic with me.

The reason my friends don’t act when I tell them how to find people like her is, I think, because the way I went about dating \[sounds really lame\].

When I was seventeen, I had no idea what I liked. My crushes would be nearly random, as if I was an unweighted neural network trying to predict which image was a cat. Then I got disappointed _a lot_ and by my early twenties, I could tell what I liked apart from what I would not like. This happens to everyone, to an extent. But some of my friends are noticeably worse at it: they are very slow at generalizing from their experiences and keep making similar mistakes. Why is that? My impression is that they tend to think more categorically. Instead of thinking _that was a mean girl_, _update the neural net to avoid her type_, they go, _oh, you know, girls._ Or, they do the same to themselves: _You know me, I have a weakness for that type_.

There is a story about someone asking Gertrude Stein if she was lesbian and Stein answering no, _I just like Thelma._ Now, the fact is that most people Stein like happened to be gendered like Thelma. But that is the right attitude: you do not like a category. You like individuals. But you can learn to pattern-match which individuals are more likely to be Thelmas if you open-mindedly reflect on how all these people that pass you by are making you feel. You can just go talk to a thousand people, randomly sampled, and see if there are any patterns in which makes you feel excited and alive and true and heard. And then you start dating people like that.

As I was saying, by my early twenties I had reached this stage. I had crashed and burned through a couple of relationships. I could tell what I liked.

The catch of course was that there weren’t that many people I liked, not in that way.

The first time I met Johanna, I was about to have a poetry reading in a bookstore. I was twenty-one and I figured she was probably there waiting to see me. She was not.

I’m not sure I understood she was a match the first time we spoke. I liked her. But I was nervous before the reading and full of myself. The second time I met her, a month later, hungover in a café, I knew. I had drunk my phone away, but I gave her my number. She didn’t call.

This pattern repeated itself for another 18 months. We’d meet in the supermarket, or on the street, or in a club. We’d have a lot of fun. There was a strong attraction. But I would try my best to signal that I wasn’t interested in that way – not that I fooled her – but if you keep talking to a stranger in the street for 18 months after they’ve stood you up, you have to lean pretty hard away to not come across as a creep. And I very sincerely felt like, god, I need her as a friend at least. Sometimes I’d suggest we’d do something. She’d say, yeah! And then she stand me up.

Didn’t that hurt? No. It was clear to me that whatever was keeping her from hanging out more – that was something she was going through. It had nothing to do with me. And also, it wasn’t like I was finding cool people I liked everyday. I couldn’t just drop the one I knew because she, for some internal reason, stood me up. It wasn’t like she was keeping me from dating others, either. I could as well be kind and funny when I saw her in the vegetable aisle.

I guess the moral of this story is: it is very rare to find someone cool. So you can’t afford to drop it. Usually, though, it is not this hard.

Eventually, she worked through what she needed to work through. Walking home one night along the same path, we came to the river. I lived on one side. She lived on the other. Where are we going? I said, trying to sound as much as possible as if I was talking about geography. She nodded with her head toward her block.

A joke in our relationship has been how incredibly unattractive I decide to make myself in this situation. Here I was, clearly having been obsessed with her for one and a half years, which both knew, and finally, I was being lead into her bedroom, and all I could talk about was how depressed I was feeling. I was reading St. Augustine at the time, and so made long references to his autobiography, and the shame he felt, which I identified with. I even, incomprehensibly to me, started talking about how good it had felt when I met my first girlfriend, and how, after I’d kissed her, the first girlfriend, goodbye, I had had to lie down in a slide on a playground, so full of emotion. Anyway, so this was what I was talking about the first time Johanna invited me home.

There is a trope in romance is that when you meet the person you are supposed to be with you can talk about anything. I guess you can sort of inverse that too: if you talk about anything that pops into your mind, you can tell if the person you are talking to is someone you're supposed to be with. Most would have been hurt by me, or bored, or appalled. Johanna’s reaction was something like: _I’ve never met anyone who takes his interests so seriously, and he’s apparently not at all ashamed of his pain. I wish I felt like that about my pain, and I need to talk about ideas like this._

Now, in this case, I didn’t talk this retarded deliberately. I was just in a strange headspace. But I do think it is a good idea

A complication was the fact that I was in a relationship with someone at this point – there are actually quite a few wonderful human beings if you look carefully. She’d been away for a few months, wrapping up her life in Boston, before she’d return and apply for a Ph.D. so she could stay with me. My sense of guilt of allowing that to implode was pretty intense.

That word, _unpalatable_, is interesting. What is palatable and what is not is often a question of context: a Western sees someone eat a dog and feels revulsion. The revulsion isn’t in the dog. It is in the context. To understand the delicacy of dog you must inhabit another world. That can be very hard. Maybe you figure out how to place yourself in the context where dogs are tasty and now you’re munching on one. Along comes your mother. I’ve just had a revelation, you say, let me tell you. But all she sees is the paw on your plate. I think love is a lot like that.

She was leaving.

I could tell though that we had fantastic energy when we spoke.

1. I could tell what I liked and what made me want to smash a cucumber to my face.
2. Now, on this particular night, I wasn’t deliberate about talking with such self-sabotaging swerve.
