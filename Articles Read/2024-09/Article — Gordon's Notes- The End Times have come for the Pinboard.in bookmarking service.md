<p data-omnivore-anchor-idx="6">In the years following the Great Recession, from 2010 to 2013, <a data-omnivore-anchor-idx="7" href="https://notes.kateva.org/2013/04/the-net-is-forest-it-has-fires.html">many web services went offline</a>. In retrospect that was the end of the Berners-Lee web.</p><p data-omnivore-anchor-idx="8">During that time, starting in 12/29/2011, I started using Maciej Ceg≈Çowski's&nbsp;<a data-omnivore-anchor-idx="9" href="http://pinboard.in/">Pinboard</a>&nbsp;bookmarking site as a kind of micro blog.&nbsp;</p><p data-omnivore-anchor-idx="10">Pinboard filled part of the Google Reader Social vacuum. There were various apps and services around pinboard, in addition to IFTTT, that made that feasible. My <a data-omnivore-anchor-idx="11" href="https://pinboard.in/u:jgordon/t:s">Pinboard 's' posts</a> were published to Twitter, then app.net, and <a data-omnivore-anchor-idx="12" href="https://tech.kateva.org/2023/01/using-ifttt-webhook-to-post-rss-feed.html">most recently Mastodon</a> (and probably a few other services too). They were also archived in <a data-omnivore-anchor-idx="13" href="http://kateva.org/sh">kateva.org/sh</a>.&nbsp;</p><p data-omnivore-anchor-idx="14">Pinboard imported my old Google Reader social bookmarks so it's a pretty complete set of things I shared, mostly tech and events that seemed to have potential lasting meaning. There are over 50,000 pins now. There were apps written for Pinboard, creating a small ecosystem of added value.</p><p data-omnivore-anchor-idx="15">I'm still on my original subscription plan - about $20 a year or so. It ends in Feb 2025 and I won't be renewing. I feel like it's 2013 again.</p><p data-omnivore-anchor-idx="16">Over the past few years there have been a slowly increasing number of pinboard outages with less communication. While debugging the last outage I purged my local history from the 3rd party Pins iOS app and found that Pinboard was throttling their download API. I could download only 100 of my 50,000 or so pins. (It's still easy to download the whole set as a file).&nbsp;</p><p data-omnivore-anchor-idx="17">That's ominous, but more importantly Pinboard is a one person show and that person is no longer responding to support emails. Maciej is no longer active on social media that I know of. His Pinboard.in support forum has been quiescent for years. I'll be researching my micro blog options and I'll write about what I come up with on tech.kateva.org.&nbsp;</p><p data-omnivore-anchor-idx="18">10 years is an eternity on the web. Pinboard had a good run, but it too is passing. I have my archives and you can still download JSON or HTM versions of past bookmarks. I might wish for a more graceful end but Pinboard was a good service while it lasted and there is a clear data exit if not a clear replacement. Thank you, Maciej, for the value you delivered to me.</p><p data-omnivore-anchor-idx="19">Update: via a Mastodon friend a Hacker News article on the ignominious end of Pinboard and some alternatives:&nbsp;<a data-omnivore-anchor-idx="20" href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41533958">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=41533958</a></p>
