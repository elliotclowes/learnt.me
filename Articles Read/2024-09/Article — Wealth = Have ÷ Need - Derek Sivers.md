	Not a new idea, but just another visualization and reminder.
</p><p data-omnivore-anchor-idx="7">
	Wealth, <strong data-omnivore-anchor-idx="8">feeling like you have plenty</strong>, is an equation.
</p><p data-omnivore-anchor-idx="9">
	Wealth = Have ÷ Need
</p><p data-omnivore-anchor-idx="10">
	If you have nothing, then focus on having some.
</p><p data-omnivore-anchor-idx="11">
	Once you have some, <strong data-omnivore-anchor-idx="12">the easiest way to increase your wealth is to decrease your needs</strong>.
</p><p data-omnivore-anchor-idx="13">
	Have 10 but think you need 100?
	You are poor.
</p><p data-omnivore-anchor-idx="14">
	Have 10 but only need 5?
	You are wealthy.
</p><p data-omnivore-anchor-idx="15">
	Have 10 but are happy with 1?
	You are <em data-omnivore-anchor-idx="16">very</em> wealthy.
</p><p data-omnivore-anchor-idx="17">
	<strong data-omnivore-anchor-idx="18">Making money depends on other people</strong>, so it’s harder.
	It’s not entirely under your control.
	It’s an outer game.
</p><p data-omnivore-anchor-idx="19">
	Reducing what you need is easier.
	It’s entirely under your control.
<strong data-omnivore-anchor-idx="20">
	It’s an inner game.
</strong>
</p><p data-omnivore-anchor-idx="21">
	I used to look for ways to make money, but I haven’t done that in years.
	Now I keep looking for ways to <strong data-omnivore-anchor-idx="22">need less and want less</strong>.
