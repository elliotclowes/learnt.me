										<p data-omnivore-anchor-idx="6">Mario Draghi, the former Jerome Powell of the European Union, was tasked with writing <a data-omnivore-anchor-idx="7" href="https://commission.europa.eu/document/download/97e481fd-2dc3-412d-be4c-f152a8232961_en" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a detailed report</a> on the economic competitiveness (or lack thereof) in Europe.</p>
<p data-omnivore-anchor-idx="8">His findings are striking.</p>
<p data-omnivore-anchor-idx="9">Here are some facts and figures that stood out:</p>
<p data-omnivore-anchor-idx="10"><em data-omnivore-anchor-idx="11">Across different metrics, a wide gap in GDP has opened up between the EU and the US, driven mainly by a more pronounced slowdown in productivity growth in Europe. Europe’s households have paid the price in foregone living standards. <strong data-omnivore-anchor-idx="12">On a per capita basis, real disposable income has grown almost twice as much in the US as in the EU since 2000.</strong></em></p>
<p data-omnivore-anchor-idx="13"><em data-omnivore-anchor-idx="14">Europe is stuck in a static industrial structure with few new companies rising up to disrupt existing industries or develop new growth engines. In fact, <strong data-omnivore-anchor-idx="15">there is no EU company with a market capitalisation over EUR 100 billion that has been set up from scratch in the last fifty years</strong>, while all six US companies with a valuation above EUR 1 trillion have been created in this period.</em></p>
<p data-omnivore-anchor-idx="16"><em data-omnivore-anchor-idx="17">The EU is entering the first period in its recent history in which growth will not be supported by rising populations. <strong data-omnivore-anchor-idx="18">By 2040, the workforce is projected to shrink by close to 2 million workers each year.</strong></em></p>
<p data-omnivore-anchor-idx="19"><em data-omnivore-anchor-idx="20"> EU companies still face electricity prices that are 2-3 times those in the US. Natural gas prices paid are 4-5 times higher.</em></p>
<p data-omnivore-anchor-idx="21">Draghi offers some solutions for closing the competitiveness gap by reducing barriers to innovation, increasing investment in certain areas and establishing an education curriculum that facilitates technological breakthroughs.</p>
<p data-omnivore-anchor-idx="22">Here’s one solution Draghi didn’t offer — more air conditioning.</p>
<p data-omnivore-anchor-idx="23">The world is getting hotter.</p>
<p data-omnivore-anchor-idx="24"><a data-omnivore-anchor-idx="25" href="https://www.axios.com/2024/04/23/europe-fastest-warming-continent-climate-change" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Europe</a> is the fastest-warming continent, with average temperatures rising at double the global average.</p>
<p data-omnivore-anchor-idx="26">Look at this chart from <a data-omnivore-anchor-idx="27" href="https://www.apolloacademy.com/the-daily-spark/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Torsten Slok</a>:<img data-omnivore-anchor-idx="28" data-omnivore-original-src="https://awealthofcommonsense.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Screenshot-2024-09-09-085048.png" fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" src="https://proxy-prod.omnivore-image-cache.app/1306x687,sSmZBFhefffPLIPRDmzRNey4dU1FVGJtFBKQ3niGB_Bc/https://awealthofcommonsense.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Screenshot-2024-09-09-085048.png" alt="" width="1306" height="687" srcset="https://proxy-prod.omnivore-image-cache.app/1306x0,s0WQMfWuF1aHYDJwBrEKqfWIltF02j5dFv807-8ZI45Q/https://awealthofcommonsense.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Screenshot-2024-09-09-085048.png 1306w,https://proxy-prod.omnivore-image-cache.app/300x0,sSu-lV-F4PKOeXNs7Xty0moXmP5azjb6PA2qMeZJVWcQ/https://awealthofcommonsense.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Screenshot-2024-09-09-085048-300x158.png 300w,https://proxy-prod.omnivore-image-cache.app/1024x0,sjqwJEB7dkBs5jjXGF8UfsnB8Modnoj6q-SNpvXpfVsY/https://awealthofcommonsense.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Screenshot-2024-09-09-085048-1024x539.png 1024w,https://proxy-prod.omnivore-image-cache.app/768x0,sMj8ZeprnH0CRjGH9AQ9E7PqoB4m_rSU9IDk3VM0dEYM/https://awealthofcommonsense.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Screenshot-2024-09-09-085048-768x404.png 768w," sizes="(max-width: 1306px) 100vw, 1306px"></p>
<p data-omnivore-anchor-idx="29">I knew AC wasn’t a big deal in Europe but never realized only 10% of homes had it.</p>
<p data-omnivore-anchor-idx="30">You might laugh at this suggestion, but there is evidence that shows air conditioning is one of the most important inventions of the past 100 years.</p>
<p data-omnivore-anchor-idx="31">Singapore’s founding father, Lew Kuan Yew, <a data-omnivore-anchor-idx="32" href="https://www.brookings.edu/articles/future-development-reads-air-conditioning-and-economic-development/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">credited air conditioning</a> as one of the main drivers that turned a small island nation with few natural resources into one of the most prosperous countries in the world:</p>
<p data-omnivore-anchor-idx="33"><em data-omnivore-anchor-idx="34">Air conditioning was a most important invention for us, perhaps one of the signal inventions of history. It changed the nature of civilization by making development possible in the tropics. </em></p>
<p data-omnivore-anchor-idx="35"><em data-omnivore-anchor-idx="36">Without air conditioning you can work only in the cool early-morning hours or at dusk. The first thing I did upon becoming prime minister was to install air conditioners in buildings where the civil service worked. This was key to public efficiency.</em></p>
<p data-omnivore-anchor-idx="37">When air conditioning first became widespread in the United States in the 1950s and 1960s, a <a data-omnivore-anchor-idx="38" href="https://time.com/archive/6916319/air-conditioning/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">study</a> found that federal employees saw their productivity rise 24% when they moved to an office with AC.</p>
<p data-omnivore-anchor-idx="39">Steven Johnson wrote an entire chapter in his book, <a data-omnivore-anchor-idx="40" href="https://amzn.to/3XoTVQp" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em data-omnivore-anchor-idx="41">How We Got to Now</em></a>, about how the advent of cold — ice, refrigeration and AC — changed the course of history.</p>
<p data-omnivore-anchor-idx="42">There is a reason many of the world’s largest cities – London, Paris, New York, Tokyo — were created in moderate climates. But now<span data-omnivore-anchor-idx="43" data-omnivore-highlight-start="true"></span><span data-omnivore-anchor-idx="44" data-omnivore-highlight-end="true"></span> the growth is happening in warmer areas. Johnson explains:</p>
<p data-omnivore-anchor-idx="45"><em data-omnivore-anchor-idx="46">The fastest growing megacities are predominantly in tropical climate: Chennai, Bangkok, Manila, Jakarta, Karachi, Lagos, Dubai, Rio de Janeiro.</em></p>
<p data-omnivore-anchor-idx="47"><em data-omnivore-anchor-idx="48">The ability to control temperature and humidity in office buildings, stores, and wealthier homes allowed these urban centers to attract an economic base that has catapulted them to megacity status.</em></p>
<p data-omnivore-anchor-idx="49"><em data-omnivore-anchor-idx="50">What we are seeing is arguably the largest mass migration in human history, and the first to be triggered by a home appliance.</em></p>
<p data-omnivore-anchor-idx="51">Air conditioning <a data-omnivore-anchor-idx="52" href="https://awealthofcommonsense.com/2020/06/the-air-conditioning-effect/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">changed voter patterns in the United States</a> by allowing more people to migrate south. In the coming years, it will likely save lives as certain areas of the planet get hotter and hotter.</p>
<p data-omnivore-anchor-idx="53">I can’t imagine life without AC and am unsure how people managed in the pre-AC era.</p>
<p data-omnivore-anchor-idx="54">The AC unit in my office building invariably goes out for a couple of weeks every summer. It makes my office dreadfully uncomfortable to work in.</p>
<p data-omnivore-anchor-idx="55">If temperatures continue to rise, air conditioning will likely be one of the most important appliances in the 21st century too.</p>
<p data-omnivore-anchor-idx="56">Michael and I spoke about air conditioning and much more on this week’s Animal Spirits video:</p>
