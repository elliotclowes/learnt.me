# Article text
As a little boy, he was made to stand in the servants’ quarters on the top floor of the palace. A hunched figure dressed as a witch appeared at the other end of a long, gloomy corridor, advancing slowly towards him, turning away only when he promised his nanny that he would never be naughty again.

“I could never see the face; just a witch in black clothes coming to get me,” said Cayetano Martinez de Irujo, 56, Duke of Arjona and Count of Salvatierra, scion of one of [Spain’s oldest and richest aristocratic families](https://www.thetimes.co.uk/edition/news/madrid-politicians-rescue-the-reputation-of-king-felipe-vi-and-the-monarchy-with-their-bungling-n60pzj0wv). “It was terrifying.”

So much did the “witch” haunt his adult dreams that, five years ago, the duke, a showjumping champion on the Spanish equestrian team, sought help at a centre for childhood trauma in America. They showed him a video of a gazelle being chased by a cheetah.

“The gazelle was about to be eaten but managed to escape and then it shook itself, in this way ridding itself of the trauma,” he told me last week. “But humans don’t do that. They carry their trauma around with them.”

The duke has now raised eyebrows in Spain with his memoir, described by one newspaper as a bombazo (bombshell) landing on the hermetic House of Alba, a family considered one step away from royalty.

His late mother, Cayetana Fitz-James Stuart y Silva, the 18th Duchess of Alba, was known for her frizzy white hair, her hippie-style clothing, her squeaky voice and an entry in Guinness World Records describing her as the most titled person on the planet.

Her children, a mainstay of the gossip columns, are used to being fawned upon, but the youngest of her five sons has changed that with a book some call the “Spanish Downton”, after the British television drama. Not content with chronicling a tormented childhood, Martinez de Irujo also takes aim at his eldest brother, Carlos, the 19th Duke of Alba, who inherited most of the family fortune.

On a more scandalous note, he relates his own drug-fuelled sexual rampage — “an escape valve” — around 1980s Madrid, when he was one of Spain’s most eligible bachelors after Crown Prince Felipe, now King Felipe VI. In those days the duke was partial to cocaine, but it became an addiction and he checked himself into a rehab clinic in London.

To the outside world, he and his siblings have led lives of extraordinary privilege, heirs to a fortune that includes several palaces, various castles, sumptuous holiday homes and so much land that it is said the duchess could travel from one end of Spain to the other without ever leaving her own property.

She was the only child of the 17th Duke of Alba — and a descendant of the British Stuart royal line — and had played with the future Queen Elizabeth while living as a girl in London, where her father was the Spanish ambassador.

She inherited the title — the third woman to do so in her own right — and in 1947 married another duke’s son in what The New York Times reported was “the most expensive wedding in the world”. Decades later, at the age of 85, after being widowed twice, she astounded her family by marrying a man of 60.

“She fell in love like a teenager,” said her son with a sigh, recalling the wedding at the family’s 15th-century palace in Seville in 2011, when she thrilled a crowd of several hundred by hitching up her dress to dance the flamenco. She died in 2014\. Martinez de Irujo believes that, of her six children, he is the most like her and that she had a soft spot for him. She was far from being an exemplary mother, however: for all the exalted lineage, he said that his life as her child was lonely and miserable.

He and his siblings lived in different corners of the Albas’ historic Liria Palace in Madrid. It is considered a cultural gem, with paintings by Goya and Titian and a library containing letters written by Christopher Columbus. The boy’s best friends were the palace retainers, who told the young Cayetano tales about ghosts stalking the corridors. Besides being scared witless by the “witch” — who he realised many years later was another servant — he complained of beatings by a Spanish nanny who would threaten further abuse if he blabbed to his mother.

Not that he could do so: he said he rarely saw her except when being paraded in front of dinner guests in his dressing gown before being packed off to bed with a peck on the cheek.

His father died when he was nine but nobody let him know until a week later. He and his next-oldest brother, Fernando, were in the palace chapel praying for their father’s recovery when they were summoned by the two senior siblings, who told them: “Papa is in heaven.”

His search for maternal affection led to the beds of older women — at 15, he said, he conducted two affairs with mothers of his friends, one of them an English aristocrat with whose family he was staying for the summer. There was no stopping him once he discovered his appeal to women. “Nobody resisted,” he writes of his conquests in the nightclubs of Madrid.

Eventually he befriended the Infanta Elena, the elder daughter of King Juan Carlos and Queen Sofia. By his account, the royals were thrilled: “We’re going to be family,” Juan Carlos, a regular visitor to the Liria Palace, exclaimed to the duchess. But Martinez de Irujo balked at being a royal consort and broke off the affair.

He insists that, after years of therapy, he has found contentment. Yet the wounds are still raw: the mere mention of his elder brother when we met last week had him fighting back tears.

“Not even in my worst dreams did I think things would happen as they have happened,” he said. He is no longer on speaking terms with the brother on whose orders a workman was last week putting up a sign on the gates of the Liria Palace, announcing its opening to the public for the first time.

Martinez de Irujo was appalled. His mother, he said, was fiercely protective of the palace and everything in it. She would never have agreed to it becoming a museum. Two other family palaces have also opened their gates.

He was also cross with his brother for selling a painting by Fra Angelico — his mother’s pride and joy — to the Prado museum in Madrid for €18m. He recalled the battle he had faced when he tried to get her to include it in an exhibition down the road at the town hall. “She said, ‘No, no, no, not the Fra Angelico’,” he recalled. “She was stubborn, with Spanish blood but an English character. She was brought up in a very English way.”
