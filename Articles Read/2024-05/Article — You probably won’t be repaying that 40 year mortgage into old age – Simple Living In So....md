# Article text
The architect of Osborneâ€™s pension changes in 2016, Steve Webb, is behind a slew of shock-horror headlines of GenZ paying their mortgages into retirement age, with the discovery that 42% of new mortgages are for terms ending [past State retirement age](https://news.sky.com/story/ultra-long-mortgages-leave-serious-questions-for-lenders-ex-pensions-minister-warns-13134937) and in some cases [stretching out to 40 years](https://www.theguardian.com/money/article/2024/may/13/25-year-uk-mortgages-loans-economy). Iâ€™m not sure that the portrayal of this as people paying mortgages into old age is helpful, or necessarily true for young first-time mortgagees. There are problems with such high earnings multiples, but the risk of your OAP self paying the mortgage is not the big problem.

Why is this happening â€“ house prices are high relative to earnings. In particular, they are high near decent paying work. Take a look at [this from Schroders](https://www.schroders.com/en-gb/uk/individual/insights/what-174-years-of-data-tell-us-about-house-price-affordability-in-the-uk/), who are at least trying to put BTL landlords off from buying all the houses ahead of you.

house prices earnings multiples from [Schroders](https://www.schroders.com/en-gb/uk/individual/insights/what-174-years-of-data-tell-us-about-house-price-affordability-in-the-uk/) report

You will observe the places with lots of work have higher income multiples. If you can find decent paying work [in Scotland](https://gentlemansfamilyfinances.wordpress.com/) you will find cheaper housing. But if you need to pay 10 times gross earnings for a house, then it will be a very tough ask on a historical standard 25 year mortgage. Simple arithmetic shows if you aim to pay down 1/25th of the capital each year, thatâ€™s 10/25 (=40%) of your salary, and thatâ€™s before youâ€™ve paid any interest, or even tax and NI on earning that amount. In some ways the 40 year mortgage is a halfway house between the 25 year repayment mortgage and the landlordâ€™s interest only mortgage.

Thatâ€™s right, who else takes long mortgages? Your unfriendly neighbourhood BTL landlord, thatâ€™s who â€“ they usually go interest only, raking it in from the rent and the capital appreciation. So in some ways a 40 years mortgage is a bit like becoming your own BTL landlord, with you as the ideal tenant and no voids. You have a slight advantage over a BTL landlord in that you donâ€™t pay capital gains tax on your own primary residence, and you have a disadvantage in that you canâ€™t pretend to be a business offsetting[1](#fn-16948-1 "Read footnote.") interest and maintenance off income tax.

What else happens over time? Money loses value. I recall the sound of the end date for my first mortgage taken out in 1989, which was in Feb 2014, and it sounded incredibly far away, and I imagined paying that off, living in that first house. None of this actually happened.  
I moved twice over the intervening years, once in the late 1990s, and once again after retiring. When I took out the original endowment mortgage, I was suckered by the tempting idea of doubling the money, in nominal terms.

Doubling my money in nominal terms over 25 years sounded great. It isnâ€™t â€“ itâ€™s quite pedestrian. If you go to the [Bank of England inflation calculator](https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/monetary-policy/inflation/inflation-calculator) and ask it what Â£10 in 1989 was worth 25 years later in 2014 they tell you that it was worth Â£ 19.15, inflation averaged 2.6% a year. So I took an absolute shitload of opaque with profits endowment fund risk for a whopping theoretical win[2](#fn-16948-3 "Read footnote.") of 4.5%. Well done me, eh? Sucker.

The point, however, is that while your shocking 40 year mortgage is say 10 times your current salary, in real terms this money will about halve in real value in 25 years. You will probably earn more by then, too, if you get any career progression by being better at what you do. So in practice you will probably not be carrying the heavy load of this mortgage into old age. Firstly you will probably have a different mortgage on a different house, and secondly even if you stay put, the real value of capital amount will depreciate over time. If your earnings keep up with inflation, you will have more coming in in nominal terms than your 25-year younger self, and even more nominally relative to your 40 year younger self

None of this is to say that paying 10 times your salary isnâ€™t a shocking amount of money to pay for a house, and you will have to qualify the risk of house prices falling in nominal terms yourself. I didnâ€™t, and [have been spitting bricks about residential property](https://simplelivingsomerset.wordpress.com/2014/04/06/when-not-to-buy-a-house-a-cautonary-tale-from-a-quarter-of-a-century-ago/) as a horrible investment for 35 years. While I did lose money on that first house, I roughly doubled the money on the next one, where I lived for about 18 years. I cleared my mortgage after 20 years, not 25, even having taken all that crap initially.

The tragedy is that your exposure to risk in general and negative equity in particular is at its highest when you are youngest and have no equity[3](#fn-16948-2 "Read footnote.") in the house. If you stay on the horse and are not unseated, it comes good in the end. That will be harder early into a 10\* earnings multiple than my 5 times, undoubtedly. I stayed with it and I did pay off the house price fall. It took me 12 years to recover to the point where I had broken even owning compared to renting from a slumlord.

Donâ€™t take the dire stories as your 67 years old self carrying the same load of your current mortgage as it is now â€“ inflation will lift the load over time. I dialled in on the BoE calculator how much Â£10 from 40 years ago would be worth now. about Â£31, so the load has fallen by two thirds in real terms. That is not what you need to be fearful of.

The big hazards of such a big mortgage are firstly negative equity â€“ the fact that I am still snarling about residential property 35 years on indicate thatâ€™s not a terrific experience and one that stays with you even if it works out OK in the end. The second is that the [risk of a relationship breakdown](https://www.harbourfamilylaw.co.uk/how-many-marriages-end-in-divorce-in-the-uk/) is highest in the early years, often after having children â€“ from that link

> ==Almost half of divorces happen in the first 10-12 years of marriage, and the rate is especially high between the fourth and eighth anniversary. Divorce rates are higher among couples in their 20s====,== ==however, the average age of divorce is 45 for men and 42 for women.==

This interacts badly with high mortgages early in life because you have little equity accumulated, particularly for mortgage terms of 40 years rather than 25.

Compared to these hazards the risk of carrying a heavy mortgage load as an OAP are low, both because inflation will probably halve the burden at least and you probably will earn more in mid career than at the start.

Thereâ€™s nothing good about 10 times earnings multiples and 40 year mortgages relative to the historical 5 times multiples and 25 year terms. They will impair your ability to save for a pension later on relative to lower multiples.

If you can avoid high cost of living areas do so. I didnâ€™t realise properly when I was starting work in London how much of an impact that made â€“ donâ€™t focus on the gross salary, focus on what you can get for a salary _in the area that employer is_.

If you can get your accommodation costs down than that really matters when starting out. But itâ€™s a balance of risk, because there are usually more jobs in high cost of living areas, and with jobs being less secure itâ€™s important to have employer diversity. Nevertheless, London is not the only place with significant graduate-level employment in the UK ðŸ˜‰

This is only really relevant to those below 35\. Obviously if you take out a 40 year mortgage when youâ€™re 50 youâ€™re likely to be paying it into old age!

1. Yeah I know, BTListas â€“ you have to set up as a limited company to do that nowadays whereas you used to have this privilege without. My violin is tiny. [â†©](#fnref-16948-1 "Return to main content.")
2. While it was a bloody stupid thing to do for a single man, this meagre win can only be computed in hindsight, and the expectation of that time was better. Inflation and interest rates had been historically higher in the period before taking that endowment. Youâ€™ve heard the pack drill â€˜past performance is does not guarantee future resultsâ€™ but honestly, what the bloody hell else are you to do? Use tea leaves or Tarot cards? Inquire within of any investing scenario and all to often it comes to making exactly that assumption, this CYA statement is to help them, [it doesnâ€™t help you at all](https://business.leeds.ac.uk/faculty/news/article/713/past-performance-disclaimer-does-not-lead-to-good-investment-decisions) [â†©](#fnref-16948-3 "Return to main content.")
3. Equity being the difference in what you can sell the house for and what it would cost to discharge the mortgage loan. Itâ€™s nice if this is a positive number ðŸ˜‰ It tends to rise with time, both because house prices tend to rise, inflation makes all prices rise, and in an ideal world you would also be repaying some of the capital cost of the house [â†©](#fnref-16948-2 "Return to main content.")
