### Every Living Thing: The Great and Deadly Race to Know All Life

## By Jason Roberts

#####  riverrun 407pp £25 

The title of this splendid book may sound a bit hyperbolic. Be assured that it isn’t. What Jason Roberts largely succeeds in doing here is sorting out the extraordinary story of the long and disputatious struggle to grasp, name and codify the entire range of the world’s living things. A scientific enterprise older than science itself, it is still not complete.

Of the dozens of scholars involved in the attempt, two are central to Roberts’s narrative. [[Carl Linnaeus]], an impoverished Swedish schoolmaster and sometime doctor, is one; the other is a wealthy French aristocrat named [[Georges-Louis de Buffon]], who began his career as a moneyed rogue given to duelling. Both were determined to make sense of the outdated muddle of categories and classifications still being used to describe the natural world in the 18th century. From the time of Aristotle onwards, others had tried – the French botanist [[Joseph Pitton de Tournefort]] invented a system involving no fewer than 643 categories, all of which needed to be memorised before they could be used. Linnaeus and Buffon were more realistic and both achieved fame for their success – partial as it may have been – in systematising the apparent chaos. That they achieved this using competing approaches and tirelessly recorded their findings gives _Every Living Thing_ its dramatic core.

Linnaeus’s first big idea was a sensational one. His botanical observations led him to conclude that plants – and, by extension, animals – could be classified according to their sexual characteristics. To a degree, this worked as an organisational principle, although the focus on sex predictably offended public propriety. His second scheme – elaborated over many years and still, much altered, at the heart of modern taxonomy – was more acceptable. He called for a series of five graduated categories, like a set of nested boxes (kingdom, class, order, genus and species). He also, radically, insisted on the identification of species using simple binomial names instead of the clumsy multiword terms then in general use.

Linnaeus did, however, have an intellectual problem. He was locked into believing, like most people of his time, that species were fixed and inalterable. They could be placed in order and be expected to stay there. After all, according to the Bible they had been created by God. This helped drive him into some pretty weird taxonomical tangles, as when he found it necessary to class scorpions and aquatic crabs as insects. Buffon, on the other hand, was more broad-minded, even anti-religious, and somewhat more patient. He was not bound by religious thinking; he accepted the idea of species fluidity and might even (in Roberts’s generally pro-Buffon opinion) be regarded as a sort of evolutionist _avant la lettre_.  
Exactly what distinguished one species from another was itself a matter of debate. To Linnaeus, it was likeness or ‘appearance’,a principle that carried him into racism when he set about categorising humans and defined _Homo sapiens afer_ (‘African man’) as ‘sly, slow, careless’. Buffon recognised that a species was really best defined not by how it looked but by its ability to reproduce itself over several generations.

Both Linnaeus and Buffon – ‘savants’, as they were called – pursued a new approach to natural history. They insisted on first-hand observation, spending years studying plants and animals and recording their characteristics in detail, instead of simply quoting ancient authorities like Theophrastus and Pliny. And with an assiduity that cannot but impress, they wrote down and published what they learned in dozens of volumes. (When Buffon died in [[1788]], only months before the French Revolution, he was hard at work on the thirty-seventh volume of his _Histoire Naturelle_ – on whales).

Buffon’s laboratory comprised the menagerie and gardens at his own estate at Montbard, where he installed hundreds of birds and animals, including a chimp named Jocko, a lion and even a beaver. He also worked for half a century as intendant of the Jardin du Roi on the outskirts of Paris, which he took over in a derelict state and gradually made into a major research centre with more than sixty thousand stock plants.

Linnaeus was also devoted to research, particularly on plants. When he could afford it (or could convince willing acolytes to take on the job for free), he sent collectors to distant regions to find unfamiliar specimens – he was himself, Roberts says, ‘temperamentally ill-suited to be a field researcher’. The account of his awful and hilarious expedition into Lapland, where he rode an unsaddled horse wearing only a small conical woman’s hat to keep off the ceaseless rain, makes this point vividly clear.
