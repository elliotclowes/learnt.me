### Big Caesars and Little Caesars: How They Rise and How They Fall – From Julius Caesar to Boris Johnson

## By Ferdinand Mount

#####  Bloomsbury Continuum 304pp £20 

Let’s begin by saying what this book is not. In 1938 the _Manchester Guardian_’s former Berlin correspondent Frederick Voigt published a remarkable book, _Unto Caesar._ It chronicled the rise of religio-fascist regimes, including the one that brought to an abrupt end Voigt’s twelve years of reporting in Germany. A year later, Alfred Cobban, a distinguished historian of France at UCL, published _Dictatorship: Its History and Theory_,another fine book which is not remembered much today. The advent in our own time of Trump, Bolsonaro, Erdoğan, Orbán and Putin has similarly given rise to works about dictators and tyrants by writers such as Frank Dikötter and Timothy Snyder, as well as an avalanche of works about populism in various geographies. Many of these expertly explain the contrived politics of ‘them versus us’ and how renegade members of the elite posture as men and women of the people. 

There is not much of any of that in Ferdinand Mount’s book, which is stronger on Cromwell than almost anyone else. Mount is a novelist and constitutional thinker whose experiences include a two-year stint in Thatcher’s Downing Street policy unit and the editorship of the _TLS._ His new book is in essence an excoriating attack on Boris Johnson (with a few remarks about the ‘Instagram diplomacy’ of Liz Truss) swaddled in a lot of history about regressions from parliamentary government and the rule of law.

There are three basic problems with what is otherwise a thoughtful and cogent account of the Johnson premiership. Mount never properly explains who or what is a Big Caesar or a Little Caesar (nor does he mention Mervyn LeRoy’s 1931 gangster film _Little Caesar_, incidentally), though Thomas Carlyle’s _On Heroes, Hero-Worship, and the Heroic in History_ seems to have something to do with it. He mentions Erdoğan, Orbán and the rest of the current crop of strongmen a few times, and talks a bit about Trump, whose rise surely speaks to an excessive faith in the abilities of businessmen. As for Johnson’s own putative Caesarism, we can be fairly sure than in fifty years neither his tactics nor his literary output (his 2004 novel _Seventy-Two Virgins_ has not aged well) will be studied much, whereas Caesar’s works are in universities and military academies two millennia after his death. Johnson is a Lilliputian figure in a country he has done so much to diminish.

The well-connected Mount is somewhat incurious about how Johnson rose once he took his finely honed bohemian act onto a bigger stage than ‘School’. How many friends of the jovial alleged wife-beater Stanley decided to give his ‘boy’ a leg up at _The_ _Times_, _The_ _Telegraph_ and _The_ _Spectator_? Johnson’s career choice helped him ensure that the press was well disposed towards him when he swapped amusingly lying about Brussels, bananas and condoms for riding the up escalator to become an MP, London’s mayor, foreign secretary and prime minister. As with Trump and _The Apprentice_, Johnson’s appearances on _Have I Got News for You_ helped establish his credibility, but we learn little about the TV producers who helped sell these wild-haired blond ‘characters’ to the public. 

Mount takes the non-elective institutional buttresses of our polity seriously, at one point comparing Johnson’s ‘Five Acts’ of 2019–22 with the notorious Six Acts of Lord Liverpool’s government two centuries before. Centring on ‘wedge issues’, these illiberal measures were designed to consolidate support for the government in the face of liberal opposition. During his premiership, Johnson ended the Fixed-term Parliaments Act, expelled twenty-one very able MPs, sacked five permanent secretaries (as well as the Cabinet secretary Mark Sedwill, whom he replaced with a courtier, Simon Case) and sought to curtail judicial review. Whereas it was made easier for (largely Conservative-supporting) expats to vote, ways were found to discourage the most marginal people in our society from being able to vote, while the Electoral Commission was neutered. Although Mount is entirely right in his defence of Parliament and the rule of law, he does not explore how we might make young citizens care about them. Perhaps explaining what happens in Russia if an average family’s saloon collides with an oligarch’s speeding SUV convoy would bring home the consequences of state lawlessness.

We are probably done with Johnson, despite the efforts of Peter Cruddas, Nadine Dorries, David Frost, Jacob Rees-Mogg and the rest of the tribute act to bring the aged rocker back for a final gig should Rishi Sunak fall off his shaky stage before the next general election. Speaking of Frost, Mount is incorrect in saying he was ‘one of the few in the Foreign Office who had always loathed the EU’. Frost certainly did not espouse that view during his stints in the Foreign Office and the Department for Business, where he served as a trade expert, or as CEO of the Scotch Whisky Association, a position he took after his diplomatic career had hit a ceiling.
