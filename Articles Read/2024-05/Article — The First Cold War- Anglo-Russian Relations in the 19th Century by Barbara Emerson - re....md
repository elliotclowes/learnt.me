### The First Cold War: Anglo-Russian Relations in the 19th Century

## By Barbara Emerson

#####  Hurst 560pp £35 

This scholarly, often original and always readable study of British and Russian relations in the 19th century is based primarily on diplomatic correspondence and records of ministries of foreign affairs, and secondarily on press sources and private archives. The book begins with chapters tracing the first encounters between Russia and England in the 16th century. In the 1550s, English adventurers trying to reach China via the Arctic Ocean got no further than Archangel, and merchants of both countries denounced each other’s drunken loutishness. Two decades later, Ivan the Terrible sounded out Elizabeth I about the availability of an eighth wife and the possibility of obtaining asylum in England should he be overthrown in a revolt. A steady trade evolved, with English manufactured goods going one way and Russian raw materials the other. A few Russians came to study in England (even fewer returned home). There was a lack of mutual understanding, but even in the 18th century, as Russia became a major military and naval power, there was little conflict. When Peter the Great on a visit to England roasted an ox in a palace drawing room and Russia employed Jacobite generals, protests were muted.

The body of Barbara Emerson’s study consists of a dozen chapters exploring Russian imperial expansion in the Balkans, Persia, Central Asia and China and the alarm it aroused in Britain. Only once, in the Crimean War of the mid-1850s, did hostilities break out between the two countries (it was a desultory conflict). Action outside the Crimea – in the Baltic and the Pacific – was half-hearted. In 1878, after Russia defeated Turkey and seemed likely to annex Constantinople, Disraeli and Bismarck became bellicose in their efforts to save the Ottoman Empire from dismemberment. The Russian advance on Merv in Transcaspia gave rise to music hall threats: ‘We don’t want to fight, but by Jingo if we do/We’ve got the ships, we’ve got the men, we’ve got the money too.’

The battle for Merv proved, like most imperial squabbles, to be a small bone of contention. If Emerson’s book has a weakness, it is its title: there was no ‘First Cold War’. In the 19th century, British antagonism towards first France, then Germany was far stronger than towards Russia. Russia was expanding in the Balkans and over the Asiatic landmass. Attempts by Russian explorers to penetrate territories within Britain’s sphere of interest in southern Asia led nowhere, while the Russians refused to participate (despite a Cossack maverick’s invasion of Djibouti) in the Scramble for Africa, and would not accept the offer from the explorer Miklukho-­Mackay of northern New Guinea. Britain and Russia resembled nothing more than two loudly squabbling packs of hyenas, tearing at the carcasses of dying empires – Ottoman, Turkestani or Chinese – but coming to terms when they found there was enough meat for everybody.

True, the two empires periodically denounced each other’s brutality. Chekhov’s publisher, Aleksei Suvorin, the well-­informed proprietor of Russia’s influential newspaper _New Times_,fulminated in 1882: ‘The concern of England, which has beggared the population of India and Egypt, which has poisoned the people of China with opium, which destroyed, like dangerous insects, the natives of Australia, and which, on the pretext of abolishing the slave trade, is now exterminating wholesale the numerous races of Africa – the concern of a people who do those things is certainly astonishing.’ (Nevertheless, Suvorin went on to advise Russian universities to imitate the British and introduce tennis and cricket, to divert students from revolution to sport.)

British public opinion can be ascertained from the press for the whole of the 19th century. Russian public opinion can only be gauged from the 1860s, after Alexander II had freed newspapers to comment on foreign affairs and allowed Russians (despite their horror at the food and climate) to visit Britain. Connections between the royal and noble families of Britain and Russia did much to prevent hostilities from breaking into the open. Queen Victoria had one son with a tsar for a father-in-law and another with a tsar for a brother-in-law. She herself was charmed by Nicholas I and his heir, the future Alexander II. The daughter of Semyon Vorontsov, a long-standing Russian ambassador to Britain, married the Earl of Pembroke.

Emerson could usefully have trawled influential Russian writers’ works for views of the British. In 1848, for example, the Slavophile philosopher Aleksei Khomiakov wrote _A Letter about England_, an encomium to the English, whom he identified as the Uglichi, a lost Slavonic tribe with a similar love of justice, religiousness and hospitality. He concluded, ‘I disembarked in England with cheerful amazement and parted from it with sad love.’ A passionate nationalist, he welcomed Russia’s defeat in 1856 as an opportunity for his country to reform its courts and government on English lines.

Leskov’s ‘The Sealed Angel’ has a British engineer shielding his Old Believer workforce from persecution. The normally xenophobic Dostoevsky has a Mr Astley playing the Good Samaritan in _The Gambler_. Tolstoy expressed loathing of the English abroad in his story ‘Lucerne’ – ‘Very white collars, very white real and false teeth … Their faces express only their own wellbeing and complete lack of attention to their surroundings’ – but found, through his Anglophile acolyte Vladimir Chertkov, that only in the soil of Britain and its empire could Tolstoy’s teachings flourish. In Anton Chekhov’s story ‘A Daughter of Albion’, a British governess is unperturbed when her employer strips naked in front of her. Chekhov concluded that the English, _pace_ Darwin, had evolved from frozen fish. In 1891, however, sailing to Odessa from Sakhalin, he praised the British colonists of Hong Kong: 

> horse-trams, a railway up the mountain, museums, botanical gardens; wherever you look you see the Englishmen’s most tender concern for their employees, there is even a sailors’ club. I … was annoyed to hear my Russian companions cursing the English for exploiting the natives. I thought: yes, the English exploit the Chinese, the Sepoys, the Indians, but they do give them roads, piped water, museums, Christianity, you \[Russians\] exploit them and what do you give them?

Russians never got to know Britain as well as they did Germany or Switzerland, where Russian students flocked (women could study for medical degrees in Lausanne). Russians preferred France and Italy to Britain for tourism and recuperation. English governesses, however, were considered more chaste and reliable than French ones. Britons visiting Russia were often unenthusiastic: in Robert Richardson’s _Ralph’s Year in Russia_,young Ralph is shocked that sports, shooting, Latin and Greek are missing from Russian education, that priests drink vodka and that ‘cleanliness is not a strong point with the Russian peasantry’. French novelists welcomed Russian _femmes fatales_: Louis Enault invented Nadéjein 1859, Olgain 1864 and Irènein 1865\. Decades would pass before Elinor Glyn came to portray an English schoolboy being seduced by a Russian grand duchess on a tiger skin.

Towards the end of the book, Emerson moves away from foreign policy to discuss Russia’s pogroms, which caused tens of thousands of Jews to flee the country; many, unable to afford a ticket to New York, settled in Britain. Jewish refugees, and Russian and Polish revolutionaries, given asylum by the British government, turned public opinion against Russia. Joseph Conrad’s novel of 1911 _Under Western Eyes_ persuaded some Britons that the ‘Russian soul’ was a menace to European society. During the Boer War a similar revulsion (not mentioned by Emerson) was aroused in Russia towards the British on account of their mistreatment of a rival tribe of white settlers. But even this antagonism was short-lived: the Prince of Wales quickly ensured that Great Britain was included in the Franco-Russian _entente_, and Anglo-Russian relations were perhaps lukewarm, but never cold, until the end of the First World War.
