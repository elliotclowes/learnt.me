### Pax: War and Peace in Rome’s Golden Age

## By Tom Holland

#####  Abacus Books 400pp £30 

One of the most famous of any historian’s judgements is Gibbon’s claim that the second century of the Roman Empire was ‘the period in the history of the world, during which the condition of the human race was most happy and prosperous’. Gibbon’s opinion may be questioned now or even dismissed as Eurocentric, but until at least the middle of the 20th century, educated Europeans usually subscribed to it. Within the bounds of the Roman Empire, what was known as the Age of the Antonines, the time of the ‘five good emperors’ (Nerva, Trajan, Hadrian, Antoninus Pius and Marcus Aurelius), was a period of unprecedented and never to be repeated peace and prosperity. Of course, contemporaries might have seen things differently, as Tom Holland shows in this masterly and thoroughly enjoyable history of the ‘golden age’ of Rome, which carries us from the shambles that followed the revolt against Nero in AD 68–9 to the start of Hadrian’s reign.

Holland prefaces his narrative with two quotations. The first is from the Roman senator and author Pliny the Elder: ‘Truly, it is as though the Romans and the boundless majesty of their peace have been bestowed by the gods upon humanity to serve them as a second sun.’ The second comes from the greatest of Roman historians, Tacitus, writing in around AD 98: ‘Where they make a desert they call it peace.’ Tacitus, however, put this bitter judgement in the mouth of a Caledonian chief living at the very edge of the Roman Empire; Tacitus had his own reasons for expressing ambivalence. Within the empire, things were different. There, cities were granted a degree of self-government, or even, as Holland says, ‘the illusion of autonomy’, though Rome made sure that ‘the illusion never shaded too far into reality’. The Pax Romana depended on maintaining this delicate balance.

By AD 68, Holland’s starting point, the order that had been established by Augustus and maintained by Tiberius was being disturbed. There was trouble on the Rhine frontier and a Jewish rebellion in Palestine. Nero, the last of the Julio-Claudian emperors, was popular with the common people, loathed by the Senate and despised by the army. Deposed and declared an enemy of the republic by the Senate, he killed himself (with considerable help from a slave). Galba, a veteran general governing a region that now covers most of modern Spain and northern Portugal, proclaimed himself emperor with the approval of his legions and marched to Rome, but his old-style quasi-republican virtue did not commend itself to the Roman people or, more importantly, to the Praetorian Guard, who murdered him. _Capax imperii nisi imperasset_ (‘capable of being emperor, if only he hadn’t been one’) was Tacitus’s lapidary judgement. Galba was followed in quick succession by Otho, a playboy but also a man of honour, and the self-indulgent Vitellius, who was raised to the purple by the German legions. Civil war once again disturbed the empire. AD 69, the ‘year of the four emperors’, was a horror. Order was eventually restored by the canny and competent Vespasian, legate of Syria, who went on to reign for ten years. His son Titus subdued the Judaean rebellion, destroying the Second Temple. The significance of the events of AD 69 was clear: an emperor, as Tacitus observed, could be made elsewhere than in Rome. ‘Even in the capital, the ability of senators to influence events was limited,’ writes Holland.

Vespasian, from a Sabine farm fifty miles outside Rome, came from a family that, according to Suetonius, ‘lacked even the slightest distinction’. Nonetheless he had known and survived adversity. With his rustic accent, rough humour and common sense, he is one of the most attractive of Roman emperors. Vespasian and the sons who succeeded him, Titus and Domitian, restored order and imperial authority. But though able, Domitian, who became emperor after the reigns of his father and brother, was neurotic and suspicious. He feared conspiracies – with good reason, as it turned out, as he was assassinated in AD 96 at the behest of a group of disaffected patricians.

The elderly senator Nerva reigned briefly and was followed by the magnificent Trajan, whose campaigns in Dacia (mostly in modern Romania) extended the empire to the northern coast of the Black Sea. Although Trajan was one of Rome’s greatest generals, the equal at least of Julius Caesar, his achievements celebrated (by himself) in the magnificent Forum in Rome and a column at the foot of the Via dei Fori Imperiali, the great business of the empire was now administration. In writing about Pliny the Younger and the Bithynian polymath Dio Chrysostom (the ‘Golden Tongued’), Holland brilliantly describes not only the cultural life of the city of Rome in the second century AD but also the cultural and administrative life of the empire. Great change was under way. The empire was still Roman, but the old distinction within its bounds of Roman and barbarian was now obsolete. Trajan himself was born in Spain, as was his nephew and successor, Hadrian, and both were constantly on the move and seldom in Rome. Hadrian’s favourite city was Athens.

Although Trajan presided over the greatest territorial expansion in Rome’s history, his glittering career ended badly, with war against the Parthian Empire finishing in defeat in Mesopotamia. He died suddenly in AD 117\. Hadrian responded by reviewing the empire. We all know his wall across the north of England, but everywhere, in Germany and what we now know as eastern Europe, he set a new limit on empire. The _imperium sine fine_ (‘empire without end’) which Virgil had the gods offering Rome was over. Henceforth the frontiers were fixed.
