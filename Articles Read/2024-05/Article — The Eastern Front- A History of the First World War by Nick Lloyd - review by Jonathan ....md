#### Graveyard of Empires

### The Eastern Front: A History of the First World War

## By Nick Lloyd

#####  Viking 672pp £30 

By 1914, the city of Lemberg had been a centre of learning and the arts for centuries. Here, in the capital of Austrian Galicia, Poles, Ruthenians, Germans and Jews talked, studied, worked and worshipped side by side. Hundreds of similar cities and towns dotted the borderlands of eastern Europe, the crumple zone where three empires met and identities were as fluid as frontiers. Readers can see a little of this world in _The Radetzky March_, the masterpiece of Joseph Roth, born not far from Lemberg, and in the remarkable _East West Street_ by Philippe Sands.

And then war came. Lemberg changed hands eight times in the thirty years between 1914 and 1944\. As the city’s overlords changed, so too did the city’s name, from Lemberg, to Lvov, back to Lemberg, to Lwów (when it became part of Poland), to Lemberg once more under the Nazis, and then to Lvov again when it was incorporated into the Soviet Union. By a series of miracles, the city’s buildings survived these wars more or less intact, but decades of genocide and ethnic cleansing swept away much of the cosmopolitan population, along with its babel of languages and faiths. Of a Jewish community nearly 200,000 strong, only a few hundred survived, among them the Nazi hunter Simon Wiesenthal. We now know Lemberg as the Ukrainian city of Lviv, and it is at war again today.

There are parallels between the current war in Ukraine and the fighting on the Eastern Front described by Nick Lloyd in this, the second volume of a projected three-part history of the First World War. Paranoia and an obsession with prestige, blended with naked imperialist expansion, lay at the roots of both conflicts, although this time it was the Russians who started it. Both wars opened with lightning assaults, carried out by the best professional forces, aimed at knocking out the enemy before it had a chance to react. In 2022, as in 1914, the defenders fought back with unexpected skill, heroism and luck, and held off the first onslaught. The heavy casualties of the early battles drained both sides of their best soldiers and equipment, leaving only hastily trained conscripts to fill the ranks. The war thus became a struggle between deskilled citizen militias, stuck in a deadlock of trenches and mud, where progress depended on overwhelming artillery support. Even then, every yard was paid for in blood.

On the Western Front, as Lloyd demonstrated in his 2021 book, the stalemate was eventually broken, partly by the Allies learning new ways of war, which in 1918 enabled them first to restore mobility to the battlefield and then to break the back of the German army. It remains to be seen whether either the Ukrainians or the Russians can achieve something similar. The First World War was not won on the battlefield by tactics and technology alone, however. Victory went to those societies and states best able to remobilise as the conflict escalated, harness the creative and productive powers of their people and direct them to supporting the war effort. So far the leaders of Ukraine and Russia have chosen to do their best to insulate their populations from the full consequences of war. How long will that last?

Nowhere during the years 1914–18 was the character of modern war as a state of affairs involving entire societies more evident than on the thousand miles of the Eastern Front stretching from the Baltic to the Black Sea. Here the inability of the governments in Vienna and St Petersburg to equip their militaries and eventually even to feed their civilian populations undermined their legitimacy. Ethnic, cultural, religious and class fissures opened or widened, until societies splintered, governments failed and millions of men and women were swept into revolution and terror, first in Russia, then in Austria-­Hungary and finally in Germany. What had started as a limited war of armies manoeuvring about like pieces on a chessboard soon escalated into a vast clash of social and ideological forces. Poles and Ukrainians fought for Lemberg until May 1919, and it was not until the mid-1920s that the wave of violence and horror unleashed by the First World War across eastern Europe subsided (at least for the time being). The scale of suffering undergone transcends obscenity: Austria-Hungary and Germany between them sustained approximately five million military casualties on the Eastern Front, Russia nearly ten million. Some three and a half million young soldiers died, as did another two million civilians.

‘The roots of victory and defeat’ in wars like this, as the late Sir Michael Howard explained, ‘often have to be sought far from the battlefield, in political, social, and economic factors which explain why armies are constituted as they are, and why their leaders conduct them in the way they do.’ Uncovering those roots demands a holistic approach that integrates the traditional study of military operations with the full range of social, economic and cultural approaches available to the modern historian. Lloyd has chosen to take a different course, setting out only to ‘present the war as it appeared to those at the highest echelons of command and leadership; to show how they tried (and often failed) to achieve their goals; and to leave any judgement to the reader’. His focus thus rests on the campaigns and battles fought at the front, and he aims to tell their story. He leaves analysis implicit and finds little reason to challenge traditional views of the campaign as a tragedy of errors, with Austrian and Russian generals racing to the bottom.

Lloyd had to set some boundaries to his work, of course, since this is a huge subject and _The Eastern Front_ also covers campaigns in the Balkans, Macedonia and the mountains of Italy. Overall, however, his approach succeeds less well here than it did for the relatively self-contained Western Front. As a chronicle of the campaigns and battles fought, itworks well enough, although maps that picked up more of the places mentioned in the text might have helped. At times, though, his story becomes one damned thing after another. Perhaps breaking up broad sweeps of narrative with the occasional in-depth case study, capturing the world in a clod of Galician mud, as Alexander Watson did in his outstanding _The Fortress_,might have added variety. Nonetheless, readers keen to learn the objective of General Reinhard von Scheffer-­Boyadel’s XXV Reserve Corps in November 1914 will be happy, and _The Eastern Front_ will serve as a handy modern reference book to a campaign which, despite its significance to the terrible history of the 20th century and the resonances it has today, remains overshadowed in popular memory by the war in the west.

The third volume in Lloyd’s trilogy will presumably cover the fighting in Africa, the Middle East and Asia, as well as the maritime and economic wars. Let us hope that he takes the opportunity to pull together the grand strategies of the combatants too. Taken together, the trilogy will constitute a considerable achievement and the author is to be congratulated on his stamina.
