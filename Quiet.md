## Notes

### Introduction

#### [[Rosa Parks]]

Despite being known for a defiant act that required bravery, Rosa Parks was known to be timid and shy. She was described as soft-spoken, sweet and small in stature.

I didn’t realise that the Montgomery Improvement Association arranged a boycott of the city buses after the Parks incident. It lasted 381 days. P1-2

*** 

Shyness and introversion are two different things. P12

### The Rise of the “Mighty Likeable Fellow”

#### Dale Carnegie

Dale Carnegie changed his last name to that from “Carnagey” to evoke Andrew Carnegie. 

He was from a rural farming background and scared of being poor like his parents.

He wasn’t good at public speaking at first, but with time got good at it and started winning contests.

He started teaching a public speaking class at the YMCA. He asked the $2 a session. The director refused to pay that kind of money, thinking that it’s not a class that will be popular. It becomes an overnight sensation. P20

> Carnegie's metamorphosis from farmboy to salesman to public-speaking icon is also the story of the rise of the Extrovert Ideal. Carnegie's journey reflected a cultural evolution that reached a tipping point around the turn of the twentieth century, changing forever who we are and whom we admire, how we act at job interviews and what we look for in an employee, how we court our mates and raise our children. America had shifted from what the influential cultural historian Warren Susman called a Culture of Character to a Culture of Personality-and opened up a Pandora's Box of personal anxieties from which we would never quite recover.
> 
> In the Culture of Character, the ideal self was serious, disciplined, and honorable. What counted was not so much the impression one made in public as how one behaved in private. The word personality didn't exist in English until the eighteenth century, and the idea of "having a good personality" was not widespread until the twentieth.
> 
> But when they embraced the Culture of Personality, Americans started to focus on how others perceived them. They became captivated by people who were bold and entertaining. "The social role demanded of all in the new Culture of Personality was that of a performer," Susman famously wrote. "Every American was to become a performing self." P21

#### Extrovert Ideal

According to the cultural historian Warren Susman America changed from the Culture of Character to the Culture of Personality.

The word ‘personality’ didn’t exist in English until the 1700s.

One of the easiest ways to track this transition is via self help books, always popular in America. Pre-1920 they were mostly about ‘character’. The modesty of Abraham Lincoln was an ideal. 

In 1889 there was a manual called “Character: The Grandest Thing in the World”. In it a shop girl gave money to a homeless man and ran off because anyone could see her in the act.

But by 1920 self help books were less about inner virtue and more about outer charm.
