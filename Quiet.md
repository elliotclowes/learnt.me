Despite being known for a defiant act that required bravery, Rosa Parks was known to be timid and shy. She was described as soft-spoken, sweet and small in stature.

I didnâ€™t realise that the Montgomery Improvement Association arranged a boycott of the city buses after the Parks incident. It lasted 381 days. P1-2
