English Service is where all courses are brought on platters and all at once for diners to self-serve. 

Some feasts were so large that the tables simply couldn't accommodate all the platters. In which case they would have 'removes' where finishes platters were removed and new ones brought in. The mightier the feast the more 'removes' there were.

English Service has mostly died out in England. However you do sometimes get a [[Sunday Roast]] – or parts of it – served that way. I visited [[Walcot House]] for a Sunday Roast and everything but the meat and [[Yorkshire Pudding]] was served on a platter to be self-served. And some families still serve their Sunday Roast that way. Or if they don't they might at [[Christmas]].
