I'm a huge van of mushy peas. I mean, I only ever have it with fish & chips. But they're always delightful. Add a dash of vinegar to elevate them. So delicious.

However a lot of the tinned ones aren't great sadly. For the longest time the Aldi ones were my favourite. But recently I had the Tesco own-brand ones and I reckon they might have been nicer.
