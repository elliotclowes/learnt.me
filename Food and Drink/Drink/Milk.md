I don't drink much milk. The last time I had a glass of milk on its own was about [[2010]] I'd say.

It's not that I don't like it. It's just that I don't like drinking calories generally. And I don't crave it ever.

I would say aside from my below average consumption of cheese, I have barely any milk at all.

I have cereal from time to time. But never with cows milk. My default is [Alpro Soya high protein chocolate milk](https://www.alpro.com/uk/products/protein/protein-drinks/soya-high-protein-chocolate).
