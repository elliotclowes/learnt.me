I don't consume much [[Caffeine]] these days due to being sensitive to it and it not being wise to mix with the [[ritalin]] I take for my [[ADHD]]. However I drink more coffee than ever. Just in decaffeinated form. I like the taste. And my brain still gets a slight placebo energy increase despite it having no caffeine in it.

## How I take and make my coffee

I rarely drink coffee from a [[Coffee Shop]]. Because it is *insanely* expensive and I am happy with how my home coffee tastes.

- I like the beans from [Ozone](https://ozonecoffee.co.uk/) (they used to be called Hasbean). But they're a bit pricey and I often don't want to pay the shipping costs. So I'm less fussy on beans as I once was. Anything of average quality is fine by me.
- I like a *little* bit of caffeine in my coffee. So in the morning I'll often mix 5 grams of caffeinated beans with 14 grams of [[decaffeinated]] ones. I should probably find beans that compliment each other flavour wise. But I just mix and match.
- Between 2018 and 2024 I would hand grand my beans with a [Hario Skerton Hand Coffee Grinder](https://www.hario.co.uk/collections/coffee-grind/products/skerton-hand-coffee-grinder). But I now use an electric [Wilfa Svart Coffee Grinder](https://wilfa.co.uk/collections/coffee-grinders/products/wilfa-silver-coffee-grinder). It's okay.
- I use a [Hario V60](https://www.hario.co.uk/products/v60-dripper-set-transparent-black) now. Previously I used a [AeroPress](https://www.aeropress.co.uk/products/aeropress-coffee-maker-clear-colours?variant=40816194093122). But it's not good for making large or multiple cups at once.

## Assorted info
- When coffee companies [[decaffeinate]] beans, the extracted caffeine is sold to pharmaceutical and soda companies rather than being discarded.
- The first ever webcam was [invented](https://cafely.com/blogs/research/coffee-facts) to monitor the status of a coffee pot in the cafeteria.
