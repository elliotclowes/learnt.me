I keep on forgetting what my favourite flavour is and I constantly cycle between Phish Food, Chocolate Brownie and Cookie Dough. 

The correct answer: Cookie Dough.

Phish Food is way too sweet and I dislike the marshmallow ice cream in there.

Chocolate Brownie is fine in a pinch. But itâ€™s just a bit dull.

Cookie Dough has a vanilla base, so it can taste a tiny bit dull at times. But the cookie dough in there is so damn good.
