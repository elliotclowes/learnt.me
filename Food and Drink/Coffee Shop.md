I like the *idea* of a [[Coffee]] shop more than I actually like them. The thought of working from one appeals to me. But it doesn't agree with my [[ADHD]]. Too much stimuli.

The history of coffee and the coffeehouse fascinates me though. [["The Coffee-House - A Cultural History" by Markman Ellis]] is a good book on the subject.
