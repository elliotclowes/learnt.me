This was *the* beer of [[Seville]]. It's brewed there and it's tough finding a beer in a restaurant that isn't Cruzcampo. It comes quite recommended – as mainstream lagers go. I found it solid, if not great. But it's flavour profile didn't seem to match my palette.

Having said all that, when I went to [[Portugal]] after Seville and had some of their stuff – Estrella and Super Bock – my opinion of Cruzcampo went up as it tasted a lot nicer than the Spanish efforts.

One of my favourite things about it is the logo. It had what I thought was a fat women drinking on it. It turns out it's actually [[Gambrinus]] who is "a legendary European culture hero celebrated as an icon of beer, brewing, joviality, and joie de vivre".

I was a bit sad to discover it's owned by [[Heineken]] though.
