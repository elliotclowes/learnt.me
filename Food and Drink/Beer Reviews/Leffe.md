Only the second [[non-alcoholic beer]] I’ve ever had, so I’m not a connoisseur. I thought this was really solid.

It was a bit disconcerting when I poured it and there was no head on it, as most Leffe’s have massive heads.

But taste wise this is nice. A bit too sweet – and sweeter than an alcoholic Leffe. 

But if I drank this blindly I don’t think I would know it’s non-alcoholic.
