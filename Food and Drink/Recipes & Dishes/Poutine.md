I don't make poutine that's anything close to authentic.

I just use chips, cheddar and gravy.

Note to future Elliot: it's tough getting the right amount of [[cheese]]. But generally speaking you want quite a lot. I'd say you want a small chunk of cheese per 1/2 chip. Be generous. You don't have to eat all of the cheese if you're finding it too cheesy.
