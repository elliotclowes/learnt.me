## Old recipe

### Ingredients (7 servings)

- 2 tablespoons olive oil
- 300g onions (2 onions) diced
- 15g garlic (3 cloves) minced
- 1 kg minced turkey
- 1/4 cup chili powder
- 420g bell peppers (4) chopped
- 2 cans (400g) diced tomatoes
- 2 tablespoons tomato paste
- 3 cans beans (choose your variety)
- 1 lire beef stock
- 1 teaspoon dark chocolate (or cocoa powder), optional but recommended
- 1-2 bay leaves
- 2 tablespoons ground cumin
- 2 tablespoons smoked paprika
- 1 tablespoon dried oregano
- 1 teaspoon cayenne pepper (adjust for heat preference)

### Optional Garnishes

- Sour cream
- Shredded cheddar cheese
- Chopped green onions
- Fresh cilantro, chopped
- Diced avocado

### Instructions

1. **Cook Onions and Garlic**: Heat the olive oil in a large pot over medium heat. Add the onions and garlic, cooking until they are soft and translucent.

2. **Brown the Meat**: Increase the heat to medium-high and add the ground beef. Cook until browned, breaking it up with a spoon as it cooks.

3. **Add Spices**: Stir in the chili powder, cumin, smoked paprika, oregano, cayenne pepper, salt, and pepper. Cook for about 2 minutes until the spices are well mixed and fragrant.

4. **Add Vegetables**: Add the chopped bell peppers to the pot and cook for a few minutes until they start to soften.

5. **Add Tomatoes and Beans**: Mix in the diced tomatoes, tomato paste, and kidney beans.

6. **Pour in Stock**: Add the beef stock and bay leaves. If using, add the dark chocolate (or cocoa powder) at this stage. It deepens the flavour.

7. **Simmer**: Bring the chili to a boil, then reduce the heat to low. Let it simmer, uncovered, for at least 1 hour. The longer it simmers, the more the flavors will develop. If the chili gets too thick, add a bit more stock or water.

8. **Final Seasoning**: Taste and adjust the seasoning with more salt, pepper, or spices as needed.

9. **Serve**: Ladle the chili into bowls and garnish with your choice of sour cream, shredded cheese, green onions, cilantro, or avocado.

10. **Enjoy**: Serve your chili con carne hot, ideally with a side of cornbread, rice, or tortilla chips.
