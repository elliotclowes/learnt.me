Serves: 3 (big portions).

## Ingredients

- 1.2 tbsp olive oil
- 500 g beef mince
- 1 onion, finely chopped
- 1.5 carrots, chopped
- 1 celery stick, chopped
- 2 garlic cloves, finely chopped
- 1.5 tbsp plain flour
- 0.5 tbsp tomato purée
- 150ml of red wine (optional)
- 400 ml beef stock (650ml if not using red wine)
- 2 tbsp Worcestershire sauce
- A few thyme sprigs
- 1 bay leaf

### For the Mash

- 1 kg potatoes, chopped (if you're having roast potatoes as well then do 600 g of potatoes)
- 120 ml milk
- 25 g butter
- 80 g strong cheddar, grated

## Instructions

### Notes before starting
- Time it so the meat is cool in the dish before topping with mash. This helps the mash not sink.

1. **Brown the Beef**: Heat 0.5 tbsp olive oil in a large saucepan and fry the beef mince until browned. You may need to do this in batches. Set aside as it browns.

2. **Cook Vegetables**: Add the remaining 0.7 tbsp olive oil to the pan. Add onions, carrots, and celery, cooking on a gentle heat until soft, about 20 minutes.

3. **Add Garlic and Flour**: Stir in the garlic, plain flour, and tomato purée. Increase the heat and cook for a few minutes, then return the beef to the pan.

4. **Add Liquids**: Pour in the red wine (if using), boil to reduce slightly. Add beef stock, Worcestershire sauce, thyme, and bay leaves.

5. **Simmer**: Bring to a simmer and cook uncovered for 45 minutes. Check after 30 minutes—if too much liquid remains, increase the heat slightly to reduce. Season, then discard bay leaves and thyme stalks.

6. **Prepare the Mash**: In a large saucepan, cover potatoes with salted cold water, bring to boil, and simmer until tender. Drain well and mash with milk, butter, and three-quarters of the cheese. Season with salt and pepper.

7. **Assemble**: Spoon the meat into ovenproof dishes. Top with mash and sprinkle with remaining cheese. Use a fork to create indentation lines in the mash so it crisps up nicely.

8. **Bake**: If eating immediately, heat oven to 220C/200C fan/gas 7 and cook for 25-30 minutes until the topping is golden.

### Tips

- For smooth mash, use a potato ricer.
- Cool meat before topping to prevent mash from sinking.
- Freeze in individual dishes for an easy meal. For a crisp topping, grill for a few minutes before serving.

### Freezing Instructions

- Ensure the pie is completely cold before covering with cling film and freezing. Defrost in the fridge overnight, then cook as per instructions. To cook from frozen, heat oven to 180C/160C fan/gas 4, cover with foil, and cook for 1½ hours. Increase oven to 220C/200C fan/gas 7, uncover, and cook for 20 minutes until golden and bubbling.
