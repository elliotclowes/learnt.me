Recipe comes from 

## Ingredients (serves 4-6)
- 1.5kg potatoes (Maris Pipers or King Edwards are good)
- 100g goose fat
- 2 tbsp semolina or polenta
- flaked sea salt
- freshly ground black pepper

## Instructions

- Cut the potatoes into large chunks.
- Put them in a saucepan of cold, salted water, bring to the boil and boil for about 5 minutes.
- Drain well in a colander, then tip the potatoes back into the saucepan and shake them to scuff up the surfaces. This helps to make lovely crispy roasties.
- **Meanwhile**, preheat the oven to 200-220°C/Fan 180-200°C Fan/Gas 6-7 and melt the goose fat in a roasting tin. It must be good and hot.
- Sprinkle the semolina or polenta over the potatoes and carefully tip them into the sizzling goose fat. Season liberally and roast them until golden.
- This will take 45-50 minutes, depending on the size of the potatoes.
