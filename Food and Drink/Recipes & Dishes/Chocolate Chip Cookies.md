This is the one and only chocolate chip cookie recipe I've used. But hey, the results were amazing. Note: don't add more chocolate chips. The recipe includes enough.

## Ingredients (6 large portions)

- 2/3 cup (142g) light brown sugar, packed
- 2/3 cup (131g) granulated sugar
- 8 tablespoons (113g) unsalted butter
- 1/2 cup (92g) vegetable shortening
- 3/4 teaspoon table salt, (use 1/2 teaspoon salt if you use salted butter)
- 2 teaspoons [King Arthur Pure Vanilla Extract](https://shop.kingarthurbaking.com/items/king-arthur-pure-vanilla-extract)
- 1/4 teaspoon [almond extract](https://shop.kingarthurbaking.com/items/pure-almond-extract), optional
- 1 teaspoon cider vinegar or white vinegar
- 1 teaspoon baking soda
- 1 large egg
- 2 cups (240g) [King Arthur Unbleached All-Purpose Flour](https://shop.kingarthurbaking.com/items/unbleached-all-purpose-flour)
- 2 cups (340g) [semisweet chocolate chips](https://shop.kingarthurbaking.com/items/barry-callebaut-semisweet-chocolate-chips-16-oz)*

## Instructions

- Preheat the oven to 375°F. Lightly grease (or line with parchment) two baking sheets.
- In a large bowl, combine the sugars, butter, shortening, salt, vanilla and almond extracts, vinegar, and baking soda, beating until smooth and creamy.
- Beat in the egg, again beating until smooth. Scrape the bottom and sides of the bowl with a spatula to make sure everything is thoroughly combined.
- Mix in the flour, then the chips.
- Use a spoon (or a tablespoon cookie scoop) to scoop 1 1/4" balls of dough onto the prepared baking sheets, leaving 2" between them on all sides; they'll spread.
- For enticing salty-sweet flavor, sprinkle a touch of sea salt atop the cookies before putting them in the oven, if desired.
- Bake the cookies for 11 to 12 minutes, until their edges are chestnut brown and their tops are light golden brown, almost blonde.
- Remove the cookies from the oven, and cool on the pan until they've set enough to move without breaking. Repeat with the remaining dough.
- Store cookies, well wrapped, at room temperature for up to 5 days; freeze for longer storage.
