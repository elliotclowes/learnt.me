## You

The lazy person works twice as hard.

***

Sex is overrated. Sex with someone you love is underrated.

***

The opinion of the person who rarely offers it is listened to more closely. Reserve your judgement for the times when it matters.

***

Default to kindness. But know when to be firm.

***

Expect no applause for telling the truth. It's a rightful, but often thankless task.

***

There are parts of ourselves that are changeable and parts that are unchangeable. So much unhappiness is caused by not knowing which is which. 

***

People are often bad at *knowing* what they like and dislike. Let alone then *doing or not doing* those things. Find what makes you happy and what makes you miserable and fight hard to do one and not the other. Desired self image, family pressure or societal norms often makes that fight harder. But it's a fight that's vital to win.

***

You're likely either too self-aware or not self-aware enough. Being prone to the former can burden you more than others. Lack of self-awareness does the opposite. So ask yourself and those around you which of the two you are and then work on being just *aware*.

***

Curiosity is a superpower.

***

Seek not just knowledge, but the wisdom to question it. Challenge what you read; think, debate, and write to refine your beliefs. Learn to recognise biases and errors in thinking. Opt for reasoned understanding over mere information consumption.

***

Think of each of your beliefs as a brick. Ideally, your collection of beliefs should be organised like a short, wide wall. This way, if you find that one belief is incorrect, you can easily remove and replace it without affecting the overall structure. But many people structure their beliefs like a tall, narrow tower. In this case, removing a single belief might cause the entire structure to become unstable, as each belief is heavily dependent on the others. So they are reluctant to change any belief, knowing it might topple their entire belief system.

### Health

Don’t eat too much. Know the human who cooks your food. Avoid sugar and processed food. And focus on having lots of vegetables, plenty of fruit, fats from non-mammal flesh, wholegrain carbs, and make meat part of the meal, not the whole. Alcohol is far worse for you than you think.

Aside from that, all the rest is just details and only worth worrying about unless you’re doing the above *very* well. 

But if you are then you can also focus on including nuts, lots of fatty fish, legumes often, as much fermented food as you can take, a tiny bit of daily dark chocolate, a high *variety* of vegetables, and drink all the coffee you want (only decaffeinated after 6 hours of being awake though). Also aim for 50g of fibre a day and consider intermittent fasting (if it suits your body).


### Money

Getting a great deal on something you don't need is far costlier than overpaying for something you do need.

***

The wealthy utilise debt to make more money. The poor abuse debt to lose money. Taking on debt can be a useful tool, but outside of large essential purchases likes homes and cars or for sensible business investing, it’s best avoided.

And be extra wary when interest lates are low. Because of the differences in how classes use debt, times of low interest rates can cause huge divides in equality and even lead to national/global financial issues or societal issues. (2024-03-20)


## Others

People carry out some of their most honest communication via jokes. Pay attention to them.

***

Adults make a lot more sense when you realise they’re just children in bigger bodies. Expecting them to not be liable to viciousness, lies and nonsensical behaviour is a mistake.

***

People are naturally peculiar and often their actions defy explanation. Unless they're harming themselves or others, learn to accept their inherent oddities. Trying to get to the bottom of quirks is maddening.

***
  
There are some among us who are deeply damaged and profoundly broken, often due to life's harsh trials. Tragically, they carry a burden that can make the lives of those in their orbit miserable. Unless you possess a saint-like capacity to withstand the stress and enormous emotional toll of their troubles, you should not let them enter your life, or if they're already a part of it then give yourself permission to cut off or limit contact. Healing their profound pain often necessitates enormous self willpower and years of professional intervention. Far beyond what well-meaning friends and acquaintances can offer.

***

If you’ve been tasked with breaking down a conspiracy – and time is not of the essence – start at the lowest point of the ladder. If you go straight to the highest it will spook everyone below and get the high ups to ‘tidy up’ and also give away you’re onto them. And starting low makes everyone think you’re not onto much. (Triggered by a passage in [["Grant" by Ron Chernow]], p799-800).

***

Voltaire said that ”those who can make you believe absurdities, can make you commit atrocities.” Be wary of the followers of ideologies, political groups or religions who have them buy into the absurd. Don’t rest on your laurels. Do your best to ensure the second part doesn’t come to fruition.

Most religions by definition require belief in the absurd. So don’t be surprised by their predisposition for atrocities. [[2024-01-13]]

## Morals

Eating meat is quite plainly immoral. Unless it will be detrimental to your health, eat as little as possible.

## General

One of the biggest takeaways you’ll learn from reading history is the constant cycles.
