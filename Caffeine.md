What a wonderful, and wonderfully successful, [[Drugs|drug]].


## Assorted info
- People with [[ADHD]] often get sleepy after caffeine, rather than energised. I have ADHD, but it doesn't make me sleepy. Though I wouldn't say it gives me a bolt of energy either.
- It wasn't until the age of about [[16]] that I discovered that lots of fizzy drinks have caffeine in them. So I had lots of [[Insomnia|insomnia]] when I was younger. I would drink [[Coca-Cola]] near bed time totally unaware of what was in it.
- I am very sensitive to caffeine. A small ca [[Chocolate]] close to bed will keep me up.
