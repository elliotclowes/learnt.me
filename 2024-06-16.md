Woke up around 06:45. Have had a cold the past few days and my [[tonsils]] are very inflamed this morning. I’ve had to have a swig of Difflam to relieve the pain of them. At least I managed to get more than 7 hours sleep for the first time in 7 days though.

Heading to Screwfix with Mum to pick up some paint for Dad. Natalie and Charlie are moving into their new flat in Harpenden today and Dad is doing some painting.
