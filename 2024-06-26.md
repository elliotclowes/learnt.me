Good morning all. It’s currently 18°C where I am ☀️

📖 **Morning links:**

- [The Netflix show "Tour de France: Unchained" is apparently good](https://www.thetimes.com/sport/football/article/tour-de-france-unchained-david-walsh-netflix-z2pmftr0z). With the Tour starting this Saturday I think I might check it out to get me in the mood.

🧍‍♂️**Me update:**

- 6hr 15m of sleep 🛌
- I have a *tiny* sore throat this morning. But a happy side effect is that my voice sounds masculine and gravely.
- It's the last day of hot temperatures in the UK, which makes me happy. I don't mind a hot weekend. But hate a hot weekday. Give me rain and clouds and cosiness.
