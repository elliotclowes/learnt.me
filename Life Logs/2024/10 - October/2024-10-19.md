[2024-10-19 15:38:52] Back from [[Ikea]] in Milton Keynes.
It was Abigail's first time there! On the journey down there she felt rather overstimulated. And whilst it was busy inside – being a rainy Saturday – she liked it more than I expected. I think she especially liked seeing the show rooms. It helped her picture and get excited about us living in our own place together. We picked up a drink and chips from McDonalds on the way home. The chips were incredibly horrible. To the point that I only had about half. Now, we're home. Abigail is having a nap for an hour and I'm going to spend some time on my computer.
