[2024-10-18 08:33:37] Up and about since 07:00.
Don't know why I didn't lay in for an extra hour though. I only got 2-3 hours sleep the dat before. And didn't get to bed until around 12:30. Oh well. It's Friday. It felt very much like Friday yesterday to be honest. I'm about to do some RSS reading on my Mac before starting work in 30 mins or so. I haven't caught up with my RSS feeds for a while actually.
