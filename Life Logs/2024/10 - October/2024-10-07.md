[2024-10-07 07:45:28] On my way into work.
Didn’t have much motivation to go into the office today. An overcast, though not too cold day today. Also, I’ve managed to get on the wrong chain. I just presume that if the train arrives at the time my one is due then it’s the right one. But it obviously isn’t. I’ve gotten on that slow one that doesn’t go to London Bridge. Oh well, the train wasn’t totally empty, so I’ve got a seat. And I’ll just get off at London Blackfriars and switch.
