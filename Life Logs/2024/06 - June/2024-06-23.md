Woke up about 45 minutes ago. Currently drinking a Monster Energy. I’m going for a walk soon with Ben at Ashridge. 

Didn’t go to sleep until fairly late last night, but it was very much worth it. I had a lovely time watching Roadhouse (2024) and Green Street Hooligans (2005) with Abigail. We were both in good spirits and it had sleepover vibes.
