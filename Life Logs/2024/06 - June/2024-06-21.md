Not much sleep last night. Around 4hrs. And I ate too late. A McDonalds. But hey, at least I got to see a nice big moon.

Good morning all. It’s currently 19°C where I am 🌤️

📖 **Morning links:**

- ["37 (Or So) Lessons From A 37 Year Old"   - Ryan Holiday](https://ryanholiday.net/37-or-so-lessons-from-a-37-year-old/). I love these simple 'rules for life' lists. Though this isn't the best example, I must say.
- ["Rejecting GMOs hinders human progress and keeps the poor hungry" - Tom Morley](https://www.theupwing.com/rejecting-gmos-hinders-human-progress-and-keeps-the-poor-hungry/). It's good to see a strongly worded opinion piece.
- ["A beautiful garden" - Rebecca Toh](https://rebeccatoh.co/a-beautiful-garden/). A nice little article on mental health.
- 🎵 Song of the day: [Late for the Sky - Jackson Browne](https://songwhip.com/jackson-browne/late-for-the-sky1974). This song builds so beautifully.

🧍‍♂️**Me update:**

- 4hr 8m of sleep 🛌
- I broke my no caffeine commitment this morning with around 8mg of coffee beans. Not ideal.
- My energy and motivation has been in the gutter all week due to poor sleep and diet. Today's aim: at least one fruit and vegetable and no refined sugar.
