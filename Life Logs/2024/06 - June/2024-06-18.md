I picked up a virus or the flu from [[Dad]] recently. The symptoms weren't too bad. Mostly just a sore throat. But the problem with having [[Long Covid]] or [[M.E.]] or whatever it is I have is that any sort of virus can cause bigger more longer term issues.

And that's what I'm worried about with this latest virus. Ever since I've picked it up my muscles have been constantly sore. Not even my muscles actually. It feels more like my *skeleton*. Mostly in my upper legs. My brain hasn't been working as well either. I'm struggling to get back in the swing of things with work. My energy and brain capacity seems low.

It's partly my own fault. I didn't eat well through the virus, which never helps.

Either way, I hope I'm back to 100% soon and that I have no long term effects.

I had a real energy dip between 14:00 and 16:00. But my energy has now peaked again.

Since I've finished worked I've been enjoying reading through my to-read list and doing a bit of blogging on clowes.blog. I've written eight posts on there today. Certainly a record. Though I haven't been blogging there for long.

For about an hour this evening, I had some crazy stomach pains. The pain was large and spread out, covering not just where my stomach is but also the surrounding organs. Thankfully the pain has subsided now. I was rather worried for a moment or two there. Fingers crossed, I am through it.
