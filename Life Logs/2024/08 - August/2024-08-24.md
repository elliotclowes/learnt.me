[2024-08-24 03:50:24] Been #Awake since 03:15.
Which I’m really happy with as I’ve got my flight to Malta tomorrow and will have to be up at a similar time. I’ve got myself a Pepsi Max with some ice and I’m going to browse Reddit for a bit. There’s still plenty to do today though. Some work to finish up and also a bunch of pre-holiday tasks like getting my head shaved, picking up my Euros, etc.

[2024-08-24 03:53:15] I’ve lit a candle in these pre-sunlight hours.

[2024-08-24 04:05:15] I swear every single finanical services website is down for maintenance in the middle of the night.
It looks like The People's Pension is down EVERY SINGLE NIGHT between 04:00 and 07:00.
