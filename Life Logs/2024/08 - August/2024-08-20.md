[2024-08-20 06:04:53] I’m #Awake

[2024-08-20 07:07:21] About to head out for a morning walk around the block.
It’s been a long time since I’ve done this. I’m happy. It’s drizzling outside, but that’s fine.

[2024-08-20 07:33:30] Back from my walk.

[2024-08-20 07:50:58] Coffee brewed.
About to read [["Quiet"]].

[2024-08-20 09:05:07] I have finished [["Quiet"]] :D

[2024-08-20 09:19:25] Dropping Dad off at the station for his cricket weekend.

[2024-08-20 17:18:56] I'm really hoping my holiday to Malta will give me a reboot – health wise.
I want to come back skinnier. With more vitamin D in me. Craving less fast foods and sweets.
