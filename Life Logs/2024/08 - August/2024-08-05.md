[2024-08-05 11:55:10] The stock markets are falling quite significantly today.
Japan has gone down 12% today. Europe is following. And I'm presuming the US will too. [[Warren Buffett]] (well, [[Berkshire Hathaway]]) recently sold a bunch of Apple holdings and various internet commenters were saying he'd only do that if he felt serious economic trouble was ahead. I didn't believe it. But maybe he's right. https://elliotclowes.com/cold/2024/https__www.ft.com_content_ef7198e5-44b4-47a0-86f5-a7bf9a34d76b.html https://www.ft.com/content/ef7198e5-44b4-47a0-86f5-a7bf9a34d76b

[2024-08-05 12:06:30] I really want to sort out my finances and stop living paychque to paycheque if only so I can start playing with stocks and index trackers in Freetrade again.
That can be fun.
