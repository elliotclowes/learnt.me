[2024-08-12 06:59:24] Been #Awake since 06:20.

[2024-08-12 07:33:38] Just making myself my morning coffee.
Mum bought the fancy stuff this time: Taylors of Harrogate. Though I do notice the bag is 200g. Which seems a lot smaller than most bags of coffee, which I presume is 250g. Still, hopefully it’s tasty.

[2024-08-12 07:44:51] Ah damm.
Coffee brewed. But [[“Quiet”]] is in the room Abigail is sleeping in and I don’t want to wake her up. RSS and newsletters in my iPad will have to be my reading this morning.

[2024-08-12 12:55:00] Having Huel for lunch.
Abigail has a job interview shortly.

[2024-08-12 14:32:14] Man oh man, I think I'm the hottest I've ever been in my room right.
The sweat is literally tumbling down every bit of me.

[2024-08-12 19:12:14] Abigail had a job interview today and she's gone out for a meal with her friend after.
So I've had the evening to myself. And probably will until around 20:00. I've enjoyed it. I booked [[Kew Gardens]] for Christmas on 21st December, 2024. And I've powered through some digial tasks on my to-do list in Todoist. I had a ready meal macaroni & cheese from M&S for dinner. It's always nice. Simple, and indulgent, but nice. I might watch some TV or a film tonight, we'll see. I think it's more likely I just fiddle on my laptop.

[2024-08-12 19:48:06] I'm at Co-op Food in Hemel Hempstead, Hertfordshire https://www.swarmapp.com/elliotclowes/checkin/66ba58c162f2ea21c0c3ef5e?s=qTS9DpfaOfWfY06mt5FyYBsfuzo
