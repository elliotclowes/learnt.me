[2024-08-01 05:18:34] I’m #Awake.
I went to bed at around 19:00 last night. So I’ve had a very long sleep.

[2024-08-01 07:09:24] Leaving home to head to work.

[2024-08-01 07:26:22] I'm at St Albans City Railway #Station (SAC) in St Albans, Hertfordshire https://www.swarmapp.com/elliotclowes/checkin/66ab2a72310a763137fb39cc?s=WoA6ubj7GA5hq0qVtEs2qqnqbzE

[2024-08-01 07:53:59] My energy is oddly low considering I got around 10 hours sleep last night.
I woke up feeling very well. But less so now. I’m tempted to pick up some breakfast at work (for the first time ever). I haven’t eaten since yesterday at around 14:30.

[2024-08-01 08:14:57] Arrived #AtWork

[2024-08-01 08:45:37] I'm having #Breakfast for once.
A Huel.

[2024-08-01 12:40:49] Nothing turns you off a burger more than dismantaling it.
It's disgusting. Seeing the meat, the sauce, etc. And it doesn't taste as good for some reason.

[2024-08-01 17:06:39] #LeftWork I have

[2024-08-01 18:37:52] Just threw up.
I felt awful on the train journey back from work. Was sweating bullets and feeling sick. Managed to survive the car journey home. But as soon as I got in I threw up. #Health
