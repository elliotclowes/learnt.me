[2024-09-21 21:09:05] Back from a nice meet-up with [[Ben]] and [[Ryan]].
Ben has just got the keys for his flat so we went out for a meal at the Red Lion to celebrate. Ryan has been at the flat all day with Ben painting. From the [[Red Lion]] I had the gammon, which was good. It was like a steak of it, rather than just those massive thin cuts. And the chips were wonderful. However it didn't come with peas. It didn't come with any veg in fact! After that we popped to [[McDonalds]] on the way home whilst mostly listening to [[Drum & Bass]]. They had McFlurries. Now I'm home and I'm watching [[Solomon Kane (2009)]]. I knew I might not have watched it for a year or two, but it looks like it's been a very long time since I've watched it. It looks like October 18, 2019 was the last time. I'm looking forward to it.
