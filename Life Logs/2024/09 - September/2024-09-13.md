[2024-09-13 09:02:29] I'm at Starbucks in Hemel Hempstead, Hertfordshire https://www.swarmapp.com/elliotclowes/checkin/66e3f1792b00004c531ae97a?s=4eRfDlX5VPNeXWqLqGe5lssktb8

[2024-09-13 20:39:45] Watching [[The Grand Tour]] (last ever episode!)
and eating [[McDonalds]]. ![](https://elliotclowes.com/cold/2024/IMG_5026.jpg)

[2024-09-13 21:04:00] Eaten some sweets.
Happy I weighed it and portioned it rather than eating from the bag. I actually found it a bit too much. I had 47g of [[Skittles]] and 38g Squashies. I think 75g of sweets total is a good upper limit to try next time. Also, from McDonalds I had a triple cheeseburger, 9 nuggets, medium fries and a small fries. That was also too much. I certainly didnâ€™t need the small fries. ![](https://elliotclowes.com/cold/2024/IMG_503233333.jpg)
