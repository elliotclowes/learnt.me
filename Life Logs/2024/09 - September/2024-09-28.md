[2024-09-28 09:20:59] I'm at Cineworld in Hemel Hempstead, Hertfordshire https://www.swarmapp.com/elliotclowes/checkin/66f59f7294f05d3562344764?s=vCp2W6Z51d8tMx-Reen_JEZ7808

[2024-09-28 10:17:30] Been reading [["Anything You Can Imagine"]] for three hours or so.
Probably the longest continuous reading session I’ve had for many years!

[2024-09-28 10:48:19] Just had spam, scrambled eggs and beans.
I didn’t like the beans with it. Firstly, the whole meal was texturally too soft. But also the beans overpowered the flavour of the spam and especially the eggs. I think next time I either need to really make that spam crazy crispy. Or just skip the beans. I really like the taste of spam. And it’s a lot of calories. So you don’t want to hide it with beans. Overall, it was a solid meal though. And I’m glad I wasn’t tempted by a McDonalds breakfast or something like that. Quite a lot of calories though, I must say. ![](https://elliotclowes.com/cold/2024/IMG_5489.jpg)
