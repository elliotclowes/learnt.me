[2024-09-02 06:56:07] Haven’t really posted much into the jrnl recently as I’m in [[Malta]] and it’s just too hot.
I don’t know how any person who needs to use their brain (or hands) gets any work done. This is not an environment conducive for productivity and effort. Anyway, I’m sick with the flu sadly. I’ve been awake since about 01:00 last night with it. Not fun. Quite how I’ve managed to get the [[flu]] in a hot country I’m not too sure. I just hope it isn’t [[Covid]]. My body is aching, which is a worry. Hopefully I make a quick recovery.
