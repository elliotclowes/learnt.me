- 06:40: Awake. Starting to get up slightly earlier in preparation of the clocks going back at the end of March. Also want to experiment with getting up at 06:00 or maybe 06:30.
- 09:26: Hoping for a nice Sunday. Actually want it less 'chill' than usual. Me and my girlfriends Sundays tend to be a bit too quiet for my liking. Would be good to get a walk in and a film or two.
