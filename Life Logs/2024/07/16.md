[2024-07-16 16:25:49] this is a test

[2024-07-16 16:26:11] let's see if this works

[2024-07-16 16:26:28] this is done directly in journal

[2024-07-16 16:26:41] do question marks work?

[2024-07-16 16:26:57] what about links? https://imlefthanded.com/2024/apples-vision-pro-lacks-a-killer-app/

[2024-07-16 16:37:34] I have installed iTerm!

[2024-07-16 17:06:04] I've got iTerm looking how I like it.
I'd been meaning to customise Terminal.app for a long time (well ever since my MacBook had a run-in with leaking coffee and it was 'fixed' by essentially becoming a new Mac) so installing iTerm was a good time. It's not a whole new world, as software. But I'm sure there's loads of features under the hood that power users will use, but not me. Anyway, it was important I got it looking good if I plan on using jrnl lots.

[2024-07-16 17:32:57] Just realised that I spent a bunch of time creating a zsh shell script to take text I added to jrnl.md in iA Writer on my phone to the days jrnl file when a much simpler option would have been to just take that text and run the "jrnl" command with that text after it.
Silly me.

[2024-07-16 17:39:22] This is a test to see if Hazel is running the script properly...

[2024-07-16 17:49:26] Ironically, "Forbidden Fruit" is the worst song on the album.

[2024-07-16 17:58:17] Man is her voice powerful on "Gimme a Pigfoot"

[2024-07-16 18:38:08] Oh dear.
I've actually felt farily productive today. I had focus and the energy to work. But I've spent all of that focus on fiddling – as always. Mostly with plain text stuff. I considered moving from Todoist for work todos and to plain text. And I've been playing with #jrnl as my Daily Log, instead of inputting into Obsidian directly, which is slow.

[2024-07-16 18:49:28] I've added a BetterTouchTool trigger so that I can launch iTerm and then type in the  command automatically after I  hit a keyboard shortcut.

[2024-07-16 18:53:20] KFC is the only good value fast food chain left. As long as you ignore the burgers and stick to the buckets, you can feed a family at a pretty solid price.

[2024-07-16 19:02:25] It's amazing how much I use shell scripts now.
I love them so much. Really opens you up to what a computer can do – despite being simple. You don't have to wait for someone to create software for you. If it's simple enough you can just do it in a shell script.

[2024-07-16 19:11:55] A few weeks ago my all too frequent habit of forgetting to eat lunch was causing me problems.
I was getting tired, shaky and cranky. But in the past few days it seems to cause zero issues. The only problem that rears its head is my RSI. If I don't fuel myself often enough that can play up come the end of the day. But aside from that, no issues. Odd. Not sure if it's good or bad.

[2024-07-16 19:12:49] Not sure whehter to have Five Guys or KFC.
#Abigail is having dinner with her friend tonight, so it's just me.

[2024-07-16 19:15:05] Five Guys, burger and large fries, via Uber Eats: £18.69.
KFC, 6 pieces, 4 fries, 2 sides and a 2 litre drink: £17. See, KFC is still cheap, as it goes.

[2024-07-16 19:16:05] Bloody loving #jrnl right now.
So much fun. Wheee, look at me typing away in iTerm my thoughts. No friction. And now that I have the shell script set up I can use Funnel.app on my phone to quickly add a jrnl whilst on the go.

[2024-07-16 19:16:54] Although, that KFC is massive.
I can eat all that, and have. But it's not wise. It's an insane amount of food.

[2024-07-16 19:18:10] Only thing I don't like about #jrnl right now is the whole concept of a 'title'.
This are little thoughts. I don't need titles. But they insist, and take the first sentance of an entry as the title, and then put everything else on a new line. Ugly. But I'm sure there's a config change to sort it.

[2024-07-16 19:20:26] One down side of #jrnl: there's no spell check in iTerm (well maybe there's a plugin or homebrew thing).
I am exposing my truly terrible spelling I'm sure.

[2024-07-16 19:21:44] Ahha.
Got rid of titles in #jrnl. I hope.

[2024-07-16 19:23:55] Meh, looks like you can't have no titles: https://github.com/jrnl-org/jrnl/discussions/1670

[2024-07-16 19:25:36] Right, time to decide what to eat.

[2024-07-16 20:36:37] Man did I wolf down that #KFC.

[2024-07-16 20:50:07] Started watching [[Air (2023)]].
But I realised #Abigail wasn't going to be much longer in London having dinner with her friend, so I wouldn't get to the end of it. Also I think she might like it too. She didn't seem at all interested when she saw the poster for it. But the energy is good. The little I've seen thus far reminds me a bit of [[The Big Short (2015)]].

[2024-07-16 20:55:08] Wish I'd found #jrnl 20 years ago (probably is about 3 years old ha)

[2024-07-16 21:09:53] I purchased a habit tracking #Notion template today for around £9. Was suprised I was willing to pay for it. Though I was sure the website offered returns. I didn't check. But I'm sure they did. Anyway, it might actually be worth the money. Because if it actually does just a little bit of what it aims to do and improves my habits then £9 a bargain. And I'm very impressed with it thus far. I tried briefly to create my own one. I mostly dislike Notion as a user, but I hate it a 'maker'. So complicated and confusing creating templates and databases. And when I got access to the template I couldn't believe how complicated it was and just how much was going on behind the scenes.
However, having said all that my first day has been a total failure. Of the 10 habits I created I have achieved none of them.

And it's a shame, because for a brief window, despite it being the middle of the day, I was thinking 'okay, let's crank these out'. But it just didn't happen. Oh well, tomorrow I will hit the ground running, right?

In other news I'm about to head out to pick up #Abigail from the station. I don't think we'll have time to watch [[Air (2023)]] before bed sadly. #Purchase

[2024-07-16 21:42:29] At KFC AGAIN. As #Abigail wants one for dinner too. I’m having a sundae.

[2024-07-16 23:07:18] #Bed. The good thing about only getting 3 or so hours sleep last night as that at least tonight I should be able to sleep. Though 23:02 is later than I would have liked. I know I’m tired when I need to shut my left eye to focus my eyesight. No idea why it’s always my left. Going to fall asleep with this video on in the background. https://youtu.be/5jmrIggwCXc?si=FrQO3rj2DPj49ynA

[2024-07-16 23:10:02] Slightly worried by Thursday and especially Friday looking hot. I’m already over the summer (which never arrived anyway). I’m already in a #Halloween mood. I crave it.
