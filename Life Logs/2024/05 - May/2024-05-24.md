 - 08:31: Back from dropping [[Abigail]] off at the station. Both of our last days of work until our trip to [[Seville, Spain|Seville]] on Monday. I [[listened]] [to the Zen Habits](https://podcast.zenhabits.net/james-clear/) [[Podcasts|podcast]] on the way home with [[James Clear]] (well, part of it). I found his book "Atomic Habits" was really great, despite not getting to the end of it. But in the podcast he said he ensured he's best ideas are up front, in the first 35 pages of the book, so that even if someone just reads a few chapters they'll get *something* out of it. And that was very much the case with me. Though I really must pick it up again and finish it this time. Though I'm not sure how useful all the tips are for someone with [[ADHD]].
 - 08:35: Currently [[listening]] to [[Toshifumi Hinata]]. This is a rather [pretty piano song](https://open.spotify.com/track/02TsjdzgR8UHfNg3zcBMfs?si=a390c820425a48ad).
