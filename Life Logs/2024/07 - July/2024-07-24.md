[2024-07-24 07:29:38] Forgot to say, but I’m #Awake and on my way to the station.

[2024-07-24 07:46:36] I'm at Sainsbury's Local in St Albans, Hertfordshire https://www.swarmapp.com/elliotclowes/checkin/66a0a3389a5e100f35cd5b91?s=tpVdJ1vvs8r1FmkEQ4yhsU8jBvQ

[2024-07-24 07:54:04] I'm at St Albans City Railway #Station (SAC) in St Albans, Hertfordshire https://www.swarmapp.com/elliotclowes/checkin/66a0a4f5e0434142def72916?s=7_CjvTy0-sGidD69li0rPz-J19E

[2024-07-24 08:47:43] I'm at London Bridge Railway #Station in London, Greater London https://www.swarmapp.com/elliotclowes/checkin/66a0b1741dde5d27b21e1219?s=4qWzMK8TJG5yulIQIAShfnmiRTk

[2024-07-24 08:50:00] Arrived #AtWork

[2024-07-24 09:06:25] Another day.
And hoping it's a more productive one than yesterday.

[2024-07-24 09:07:12] Still getting issues with Maestral.
It seems to happen when I plug my MacBook into an external monitor.

[2024-07-24 09:08:05] Right.
I will catch up on email and Slack and then get cracking. #Work

[2024-07-24 10:45:24] The restaurant I made a reservation at lets me upload a photo of myself so they can greet me by name when I arrive.
I haven't seen anything like that before. I'm going to give it a whirl. And if they do greet me by name this is how I'm going to feel. ![](https://clowes.blog/uploads/2024/goodfellas.jpg)

[2024-07-24 10:48:55] Rather than pasting code in Slack and in Google Sheets I've started putting them in GitHub Gists and linking to them.
It's a bit anoying that I have to give it a name and all that (though I suppose I could just use the date and time as the title), but aside from that I like. Harder to lose. And it doesn't clog up Slack and Google Sheets.

[2024-07-24 13:31:14] About to have lunch.
Some Huel.

[2024-07-24 17:17:28] Just #LeftWork

[2024-07-24 17:21:55] I'm at London Bridge Railway #Station in London, Greater London https://www.swarmapp.com/elliotclowes/checkin/66a129149c76df0e740f503d?s=DmcEkQgOmr8eypn02-Zhcx7lchY

[2024-07-24 17:55:53] I'm at St Albans City Railway Station (SAC) in St Albans, Hertfordshire https://www.swarmapp.com/elliotclowes/checkin/66a13202b4331f69b5eacbfe?s=Z5YngW-xmJDU7Z8zTNoU5diFrkc

[2024-07-24 18:24:21] I’m back #Home

[2024-07-24 18:30:14] I should probably write more thoughts and feelings in these things. Rather than just a dispassionate log of what I’m doing.

[2024-07-24 19:04:25] I'm at Tesco Extra in Hemel Hempstead, Hertfordshire https://www.swarmapp.com/elliotclowes/checkin/66a1420c8d23a87ba8e4bc69?s=0RMyBI7Y2BgQmNMPmsH6T5gq3lE

[2024-07-24 19:33:22] I’m always cautious of a nice day. Inevitably something awful happens. I was having a good day. Abigail agreed to a Five Guys. So once we were back from work I headed to Tesco for some snacks too. Am so excited for some Ben & Jerry’s. Then went to Five Guys. And… card declined. Lovely.

[2024-07-24 22:39:11] Time for #Bed. Listening to the [[Accidental Tech Podcast]] while I drift off. Haven’t listened to a podcast to sleep to for a long while. ![](https://elliotclowes.com/cold/2024/22y35y41.png)
