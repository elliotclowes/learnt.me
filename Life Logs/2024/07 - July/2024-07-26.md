[2024-07-26 07:10:08] Been #Awake for about 45 minutes.
Not doing anything productive. Mostly TikTok. I ate too close to bed (#McDonalds chips and some #Snickers), so Iâ€™ve woken up not feeling too great.

[2024-07-26 10:08:08] It's long been a dream of mine to have a smart speaker in the bathroom.
I love listening to music in the bath and shower. And hate having to have battery speakers you see. This person on /r/sonos has mounted theirs under the sink cabinet. Smart idea for tucking it away. Though obviously they won't sound as good. https://old.reddit.com/r/sonos/comments/13zkyfo/under_cabinet_symfonisk_in_bathroom/
