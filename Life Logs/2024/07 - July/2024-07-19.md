[2024-07-19 06:27:42] I’m #Awake

[2024-07-19 07:27:48] I'm at St Albans City Railway #Station (SAC) in St Albans, Hertfordshire https://www.swarmapp.com/elliotclowes/checkin/669a073a9d3b4e1a6c8fc1de?s=2tfhaGzPFmMFnzpSRCp26E31i2o

[2024-07-19 08:16:16] #Read [["Quiet" by Susan Cain]] on the #Train

[2024-07-19 08:17:08] I'm at London Bridge Railway #Station in London, Greater London https://www.swarmapp.com/elliotclowes/checkin/669a12d1599027265bad0e84?s=QE8QlqpN3xfKL8E95rYGIVZWZ6Y

[2024-07-19 08:19:56] I’m #AtWork

[2024-07-19 10:05:38] Happy that I have a fairly light meeting day today.
Can crack on with some 'real' work.

[2024-07-19 10:06:18] This worldwide network outage is probably the biggest I remember.
When AWS goes down a bunch of sites go down. But I've never seen airports, trains and banks so affected. https://www.bbc.com/news/live/cnk4jdwp49et

[2024-07-19 12:17:07] Just #Eaten #FishAndChips. It was a mistake getting the battered sausage, and it wasn’t a great meal. But it filled a hole. ![](https://elliotclowes.com/cold/2024/IMG_3052.jpg)

[2024-07-19 12:47:55] Updated iTerm settings so it's in dark mode, not light.
Also changed the font from JetBrains Mono to Monaco. And made the font a bit bigger. It's good for jrnl. Less good for other Terminal stuff, so I might change it at some point. ![](https://elliotclowes.com/cold/2024/iterm-updated.png)

[2024-07-19 13:36:47] Got rid of the default Dropbox Mac client.
Have installed Maestral instead. Will see how it goes. It's scary! You don't want to play around with your files like this. But I'm tired of Dropbox constantly using 800 MB of RAM.

[2024-07-19 16:40:03] Mmm.
Maestral is current hanging. I didn't have this with the Dropbox client.

[2024-07-19 17:31:47] I have #FinishedWork

[2024-07-19 17:32:43] I'm at London Bridge Railway #Station in London, Greater London https://www.swarmapp.com/elliotclowes/checkin/669a950e535607014693ebaa?s=YjlotiffzElRbpwFQd-HTlBY5bs

[2024-07-19 18:36:52] I feel mostly fine all day. And then during the last 1/2 of my train journey home I all of a sudden have an energy crash and feel awful. Happens ALL THE TIME.

[2024-07-19 20:02:49] Just #Ate at a #McDonalds whilst watching [[House of the Dragon]].

[2024-07-19 22:15:59] Finding it tough to stick to my social media limit today.

[2024-07-19 23:31:53] Too hot to sleep. Luckily this is the last day of heat in the UK.

[2024-07-19 23:42:33] There was a recent Diggnation reunion recently. But it was really just a catchup chat, not a reunion episode. Well, there’s now a part two that is like a full on episode. So I’m #Watching it. I am so incredibly happy right now. https://youtu.be/Cd7vhmaKP6E?si=FQUNTUnh_6XE9e2R
