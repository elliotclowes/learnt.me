[2024-07-23 06:33:05] I’m #Awake.

[2024-07-23 08:05:15] Back #Home after dropping #Abigail off at the station.

[2024-07-23 08:05:48] I can't find my Moleskine pocket notebook :( I've grown so weirdly attatched to it (sadly not physically).

[2024-07-23 17:23:07] I knew fountain pens can be expensive.
But it's odd seeing one casually listed at £1,200. https://cultpens.com/products/visconti-homo-sapiens-earth-origins-fountain-pen-air

[2024-07-23 17:25:26] Added 'The Five Minute Journal' to my Amazon wishlist.

[2024-07-23 17:48:47] About to go pick up #Abigail.

[2024-07-23 18:40:01] I'm at Texaco Garage in Hemel Hempstead, Hertfordshire https://www.swarmapp.com/elliotclowes/checkin/669feac78e6b77403406d629?s=N8v7tEQk18Oaoa-3f2Mxy9yi7lU

[2024-07-23 23:40:15] Had an argument with #Abigail tonight. Then #Watched a few of Bon Appétit’s ‘Gourmet Makes’ on YouTube. Now it’s time for #Bed. Going to listen to these rain sounds in the background. I really like it. It’s really high quality audio. And the screen is totally black. So it doesn’t light up the room, use loads of power, or make me worry about my OLED TV getting burn-in. https://www.youtube.com/live/eLnLpYpHV4k?si=-JpKpOxu83dMGUGT
