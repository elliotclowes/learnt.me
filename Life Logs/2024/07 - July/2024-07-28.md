I was going to write about how it’s been a long and eventful day. But then I realised all I’ve done is gone to London for a meal and a Shakespeare play. Not exactly a grand day out full of adventure and intrigue. But, the thing is, for me that is a grand these days. It takes a lot to get me to leave the comfort of my home.
