I've gotten more into note taking on paper in the past few days, mostly for to-dos.

The reason being that I've heard that the act of writing activates a different part of the brain compared to typing. So you're more likely to remember it.

But it's a tough sell. There's so many things in the 'con' column of notebooks, especially when compared to my to-do app of choice, [[Todoist]]:

- They're expensive. I like [Field Notes](https://fieldnotesbrand.com/). But they're about £5 per notebook (with 48 pages, that's £0.10 per page). And they're not big pages.
- It's so easy to lose them. The chances of my Todoist data going missing is close to zero.
- I nearly always have my phone on me. But carrying a notebook is another thing to carry.
- A notebook can't send you a notification. It can't remind me to do something at 18:00 like Todoist can.
- You can move things around. It's a linear list of things. With Todoist I can move things from project to project. If there's a to-do in my notebook that has been there for a while it will be many pages back, surrounded by finished tasks. Easy to miss it.

My brain is not working very well at all today. And I’m tired. And I have no motivation.
