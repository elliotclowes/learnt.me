[2024-07-25 06:29:56] I’m #Awake

[2024-07-25 06:52:33] Two nights in a row where I’ve slept well. I’m hoping today my brain rewards me for that with _some_ capacity for productivity today.

[2024-07-25 06:59:42] Just had a #Shower. It’s hot in the UK at the minute (well, 18-24c, but with overcast skies). I opened the bathroom window before getting into the shower. When I got out it was surprisingly cold – rather nippy. And it that moment it made me crave autumn/winter. When you get out of a lovely hot shower into the crisp, cold air. The contrast stark and wonderful. The coldness really _feels_ like winter. And it’s both a slightly annoying but also lovely feeling. I’m looking forward to it again.

[2024-07-25 07:17:03] I forgot to say, I also #Shaved.

[2024-07-25 07:33:49] I'm at St Albans City Railway #Station (SAC) in St Albans, Hertfordshire https://www.swarmapp.com/elliotclowes/checkin/66a1f1a01ff2c37c1e1f8681?s=74WfOstvVVP8t1kbHOrT5zJw1P0

[2024-07-25 08:33:04] Arrived #AtWork

[2024-07-25 09:33:59] I had a brief moment of weakness where I thought about logging my toilet visits in here.
Nope. No. Never

[2024-07-25 09:37:06] Installed iTerm on my Mac mini too.
I didn't like having it look different on there compared to my Mac.

[2024-07-25 09:43:35] This is a test.
Just me doing some writing. To see if it goes on a new line.

[2024-07-25 09:56:30] Keep on getting hot flushes once or twice a day.
Usually around 14:00-16:00. But I've got one now at 10:00 for some reason. Not sure the cause. #Health

[2024-07-25 09:57:58] I don't usually come into the office on a Thursday.
It's very busy on the trains and streets as lots of people WFH on a Friday now. So it's one of the busiest days. But I'm in today. Because a) work was offering free headshots (which have now be cancelled). And b) Abigail is WFH on Friday, so we can WFH together. But anyway, the office is dead. Which I wasn't expecting.

[2024-07-25 10:04:11] I may have poo pooed the idea of logging toilet breaks (if you excuse the pun).
But I do like the idea of logging health issues on here. Might be useful – you never know. So, maybe TMI, but: I've had this issue of getting numbness in my left buttock and testicle. It's been going on for a while. But has been getting worse recently. It's always when sitting. But it used to just be on hard seats. But I'm even getting it on comfy office chairs now. And getting it more often on uncomfy chairs. #Health

[2024-07-25 10:06:32] I brought a Huel in for lunch today.
But in the office canteen it's chicken shawarma loaded fries. So I'm tempted by that instead. We'll see.

[2024-07-25 16:59:00] Back home from work.
Very quiet in the office today, spent the day focused on just one thing really - GA4 - aside from some meetings. Abigail is having some drinks after work. So I'll be alone until around 20:00. What will I do? Probably the same thing I've been doing all day: on my computer.

[2024-07-25 17:59:48] Ordering some curry.

[2024-07-25 21:44:51] Not a very productive evening.
I had my #Curry and spent time on TikTok. Abigail isn’t back yet. And I’ve just spent 20 or so minutes downstairs with the parents.
