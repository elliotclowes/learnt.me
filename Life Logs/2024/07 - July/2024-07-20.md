[2024-07-20 00:15:20] Struggling to sleep. Partly due to this heat. Forgot to say that I #Meditated today again. Wasn’t a great one as it was done in the train, without headphones, and with a man playing TikTok next to me. But still, I’m so glad I’m getting into a slight habit with it.

[2024-07-20 00:30:18] Going to try and get some sleep, despite the fact that there’s literal beads of sweat on my head right now. https://elliotclowes.com/cold/2024/nobody.mp4

[2024-07-20 16:49:46] A few weeks ago I tried note taking and todo planning with a paper notebook.
It was quite nice. It played nicely with my ADHD brain too. Ticking things off with a pen felt so much better than clicking 'done' on a computer. And because the todos 'physically' existed I would remember them but. But of course it has its downsides. It's much slower to get things into it. Especially as my hand writing is terrible unless I really take my time. And the todos can't be moved, grouped or filtered. It's just a linear list (unless I'm willing to re-write things to move them). So I abandoned it after a few days of trying it. But today whilst in #StAlbans I was in WHSmith and saw some notebooks by a brand called Moderno (which is apparently WHSmith-owned). I liked how they were similar in size to by pocket Moleskine, but a little wider. And that has reignited my interest in notebooks again.

[2024-07-20 21:43:23] My sweet tooth is becoming a sweet addiction. It’s quite common in recent weeks for me to not fancy some sweets at all, but yet I have some all the same. Not good. A bad sign. Something I need to fix.

[2024-07-20 21:49:54] #Watched this earlier on #YouTube. Brad Leone seems like he’s on cocaine though. I know he’s kind of always like that. But still. https://youtu.be/UDy3AR5dIWo?si=IPvdvrW32CLRAhKh
