[2024-07-17 06:49:53] #Awake. 7h 15m of sleep.

[2024-07-17 07:38:38] I'm at St Albans City Railway Station (SAC) in St Albans, Hertfordshire https://www.swarmapp.com/elliotclowes/checkin/669766d497213e4b8cf2e558?s=lDAOerg9nLVNmDPluuradsmmjeY

[2024-07-17 08:12:55] Just discovered the medication reminder feature in the iOS Health app will make a loud sound even if your phones on silent and you have headphones. Apologies to the people sitting next to me on the train ðŸ˜¬

[2024-07-17 08:24:45] #AtWork

[2024-07-17 08:50:29] Man was it a mistake letting go of Inbox Zero for a few weeks.
I've missed so many things and not have '0' emails just stresses me out. Sure I was the 'action later' label liberally, but at least they're all there and not missed. #Work

[2024-07-17 10:01:23] Long flowery dresses seem to be very popular these days.
I'm a fan. They're a simple classic that looks really good.

[2024-07-17 11:10:23] I'm just the right amount of busy today that I'm motivated without my #ADHD getting in the way.
It's nice, and I have motivation too.

[2024-07-17 12:11:55] Barely had time to wee today.

[2024-07-17 12:33:23] Got so many tasks to do that I'm frozen in place, unsure where to start.
And of course I only have 30 minutes in between meetings. #Work

[2024-07-17 13:52:34] Took a #Codeine

[2024-07-17 14:41:38] I don't know how I ever thought I could move my todos to a plain text system.
Not only am I visual person. But I love Todoist and its filters, projects, etc

[2024-07-17 14:56:47] Note to #FutureElliot don't skip, just get a computer with more than 16GB of RAM.
Sure, it's fine. But I've been on 16GB for around a decade now. It's time to level up. And it makes a difference

[2024-07-17 15:57:51] About to start my last meeting of the day.
A 1-to-1. #Work

[2024-07-17 16:38:32] Might actually get my end of day 'power down' routinedone.

[2024-07-17 17:17:20] I have #LeftWork

[2024-07-17 17:56:58] I just #Meditated for the first time in an age. Itâ€™s because I have this Notion habit tracker up and running thatâ€™s motivating me.

[2024-07-17 18:01:53] At #Station

[2024-07-17 18:26:06] Back #Home
