Went for a walk at [[Ashridge]] with [[Abigail]]. 

We hadn’t been for a walk at Ashridge together, so I enjoyed it. Well, I always enjoy a walk at Ashridge.

It was chucking it down on the journey there, but ceased a little before we arrive. So the massive umbrella I brought wasn’t needed and was used as a walking stick instead.

We kept it short. One loop around the park section.

After Abigail got a hot chocolate from the mini cafe. They had a luxury version, but she opted for the standard one. A mistake in my mind. Why not get the more luxurious one? Isn’t that what hot chocolate is all about: luxury and extravagance.

I popped into the gift shop once the order was ready. I love the gift shop. Cosy.

After the shop we sat and watched the hustle and bustle of the outside seating area as she drank her coffee. The dogs got most of our attention.

Once we were done at Ashridge we headed to the farm shop in [[Tring]] to buy one those steak [[pies]] I love so much. 

They do a chicken one as well it seems. So Abigail got one of those.

Cafe Dacorum was our lunch destination. We ate hilariously childishly. Chips, beans and meat. Abigail, sausage. Me, burger. It wasn’t so great though. For me anyway.

Home called after the food. So we headed home. Abigail played Hogwarts Legacy as I had the [[Tour de France]] on in the background as I browsed [[Threads]] and caught up on my RSS feeds.

18:26: Reading [[Quiet]]. On page 6-7 it briefly mentions how introverted people often struggle being introverted because it was looked down upon by their parents. I was lucky in that regard. My Dad wasn’t always as accepting as my Mum, but on the whole he still was. And I think having parents who understood my ‘odd’ ways has helped me not only understand who I am, but accept and embrace it.
