The time is 7:48 a.m. on the 14th of April, 2024. A Sunday. Yesterday was the best day I've had for a while. I was just in a very good mood. And the weather was very nice. Pretty much for the first time this year. I woke up around 5:30 a.m. because I went to bed very early the night before, because the night before that, I was up very early at 3:00 a.m., dropping Natalie and Dad off at the airport for their trip to Berlin.

So I started the day early, and actually, despite it being a Saturday that day, I did a little bit of work, not much, but a little bit. Then in the morning and afternoon, I enjoyed reading and catching up on all my email newsletters. The Times ones are particularly good. I've discovered. A lot of those newsletters I found down the years aren't worth the time, but I've got a few now but I actually enjoy and it's a good way to start the day. Although there's always the fall to the back of my mind that it's eating into dedicated book reading time. Then I walked to the cooperative to get some painkillers from the pharmacy and did a bit more newsletter reading after that. And then me and Abigail went to St. Albans. We had lunch at an Italian place. It wasn't wonderful my food, it was a pasta dish that was a tad watery (Abigail had a pizza), but it was still perfectly pleasant and we got to sit outside due to the nice weather. Then after that, we sat at the park near the cathedral on a tree stump. And we sat there for quite a while, and it was very, very nice and pleasant. Watching the world go by, seeing lots and lots of dogs, and just enjoying ourselves. For dinner, we had a sausage baguette, which we made, or I made. That was nice. Nicer than I expected. Then in the evening, we watched the first two episodes of the new Apple TV+ TV show starring Colin Farrell called Sugar with a capital S. It's very stylish and a bit camp and very old school, but I absolutely love it. It's gripped me, and it's just great stylish fun. It's a little bit of a shame that I can't binge it, but at the same time, I'm kind of looking forward to having to wait each week. 'Cause you don't have to do that too much these days.

So yes, that was yesterday. Today, I woke up at 6 am, which was half an hour earlier than my alarm clock. But that’s fine by me, as I’m trying to get into a slightly earlier pattern, what with Abigail starting another job where she has to be up earlier, so I will be too.

And if I want to do a few bits and bobs before we leave for the train station, such as reading and showering, then I need to probably woke up around 6 am. There’s not a great deal on the agenda today we’ve got a roast dinner planned that will have with mum and if I can convince Abigail to go for a little walk that would be great. The weather is nowhere near as nice as it was yesterday though, it’s about 7° colder in fact. But that’s fine. Oh one thing I forgot to say is that yesterday was the Grand National so me and Abigail watch strap. But yes today should be a good day and I’m looking forward to it and I’m also looking forward to watching the third episode of [[Sugar (TV show)]].
