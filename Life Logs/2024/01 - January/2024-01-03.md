Still fighting a cold that I picked up just before New Years, so I WFH today. A medium busy day meeting wise.

Worked whilst listening to "[[Willie Nelson#^42e4ec|Stardust]]" by [[Willie Nelson]], "[[Muddy Waters#^d968e6|Folk Singer]]" by [[Muddy Waters]] and "[[Nat King Cole#^a9d68c|Love Is The Thing]]" by [[Nat King Cole]].

## Food
- Breakfast: All-Bran, Shreddies and Chocolate Oat Milk.
- Lunch: Fillet steak, mashed potato and peas. Topped with Worcestershire sauce and English mustard.
- Dinner: Creamy chicken and pasta. Garlic bread on the side. Made by [[Abigail]].
