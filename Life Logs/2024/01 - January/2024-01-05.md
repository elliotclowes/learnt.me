Had a cold for around a week now. I'm nearly fully recovered but my voice in the first half of the day was more gravel-y than at any point. Maybe where it's "leaving" my body.

Worked whilst listening to a lot of [[Chicago Gangsters]] and then post-work listened to a lot [[Neil Young]]. Mostly his new archive releases.

*Really* struggled with my diet again. To an insane degree in fact. This is despite not really craving any thing bad or being too hungry. It felt like a weird habit or urge. I need to try and sort that tomorrow. Having to write these helps. As it's embarrassing (that food list below is *crazy*). I mean no one's reading. But still, it's embarrassing.

## Food
- Meal 1: [[Five Guys]]: double cheeseburger and large fries.
- Meal 2: [[McDonalds]]: 2 x McChicken sandwiches, medium fries, small fries, 20 nuggets.
- Snacks: Peanut M&M's / Skittles
