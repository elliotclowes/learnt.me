Working in the office today. Got the train with [[Abigail]]. Train was fairly nice and quiet. I think people aren't fully back to work yet.

## Food
- Lunch: Had [[cannelloni]] at the work canteen. Was pleased I went with a vegetarian option.
- Dinner: Cracked in the evening and my diet went off the rails. Went to [[McDonalds]]. Had a double cheeseburger, triple cheeseburger, large fries and 20 nuggets. Followed by the snacks below
- Snacks: Swizzels Drumstick Squashies Bubblegum flavour (they weren't great), Toffifee (new to me. Tasty hazelnut flavour. But they have the consistency of plastic!) and Lindt Lindor Truffles (good as ever. So much better if you can be patient enough to let them melt in your mouth).
