My "*Life Logs*" are essentially a journal, but a bit more real-time and a bit less introspective.

I might include what I'm doing, watching, eating, visiting, etc., as well as my thoughts.

To be honest, they're probably not that interesting to any one other than myself. But feel free to have a look at some of them :) 

***

I add to the logs in two ways:

- [jrnl](https://jrnl.sh/). A command line tool for quickly logging my thoughts and what I'm up to.
- Physical notebooks: I've recently got into notebooks and I enjoy the act of writing (although I'm a slow writer, with poor spelling and bad hand writing). So I will write *Life Logs* in there and then OCR them using [GPT-4o](https://chatgpt.com/g/g-Kjk6IzGWm-markdown-scribe). I use either [Field Notes](https://fieldnotesbrand.com/) or [Moleskine pocket notebooks](https://www.penheaven.co.uk/moleskine-soft-cover-pocket-notebook-lined).
