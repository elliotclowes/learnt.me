My "*Life Logs*" are essentially a journal, but a bit more real-time and a bit less introspective.

I add to the logs in two ways:
- [jrnl](https://jrnl.sh/). A command line tool for quickly logging my thoughts and what I'm up to.
- Physical notebooks: I've recently got into notebooks and I enjoy the act of writing (although I'm a slow writer, with poor spelling and bad hand writing). So I will write *Life Logs* in there and then OCR them using [GPT-4o](https://chatgpt.com/g/g-Kjk6IzGWm-markdown-scribe).
