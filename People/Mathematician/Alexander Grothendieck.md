Alexander Grothendieck was a highly influential [[mathematician]] known for his work in algebraic [[geometry]], homological [[algebra]], and category theory.

I heard about him in [[Article — Cultivating a state of mind where new ideas are born]] where it talks about his book [["Récoltes et Semailles" by Alexander Grothendieck]], which is a 2000 page philosophical and autobiographical work that has deep reflections on mathematics, his experiences in the mathematical community, and his personal philosophy.
