Senesino, whose real name was Francesco Bernardi, was one of the most famous [[Castrato]] singers of the early [[1700s]].

He was a leading star in London's opera scene, particularly in operas by [[George Frideric Handel]], where his voice and dramatic talent were highly celebrated.

One of the highest-paid singers of his time, he lead a lavish lifestyle. And he retired comfortably to his native city of [[Siena]], Italy.

Senesino was known for his demanding nature and temperamental behaviour, often clashing with composers and fellow performers. This seems to be a common theme of [[castrati]] singers.

I find it interesting that no only did he work with Handel, but he also looked like him. See below, with Senesino on the left.
