You'll probably know him from [[Gladiator (2000)]], [Oliver! (1968)](https://www.justwatch.com/uk/movie/oliver) or for being a [[Hellraiser|hellraiser]].

If you want to learn more about his exploits I recommend the book [["Hellraisers" by Robert Sellers]].

## My Yearly Pilgrimage To The Pub Where He Died

My girlfriend's family is from [[Malta]], so we usually holiday there every year. And it was in Malta whilst filming [[Gladiator (2000)]] that he [suffered a heart attack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oliver_Reed#Death) in a pub (called [[The Pub]]) after a drinking with some sailors.

The pub has become a kind of shrine to Reed and is a pilgrimage destination for his fans. So me being one of them, every year I make way to the pub and drink in his honour.
