- Charles is most remembered for his struggles with the [[Parliament]] of England, which were marked by his belief in the divine right of kings and his attempts to govern without Parliament.
- Charles dissolved Parliament three times between 1625 and 1629 and then ruled without it from 1629 to 1640, a period known as the [[Personal Rule]] or the Eleven Years' Tyranny.
- Tensions over issues like religious policies and governance led to the outbreak of the First English Civil War in 1642.
- Charles I is the only English monarch to have been tried and executed for treason. His death on January 30, [[1649]], marked a significant point in English history, leading to the brief establishment of the Commonwealth of England under [[Oliver Cromwell]].
- His execution was intended to end the monarchy, but it was restored in 1660 with his son, [[Charles II]], becoming king.
- Charles I was a great patron of the arts and is credited with collecting many works by famous painters such as [[Peter Paul Rubens]] and [[Anthony van Dyck]], the latter of whom painted several famous portraits of the king.
