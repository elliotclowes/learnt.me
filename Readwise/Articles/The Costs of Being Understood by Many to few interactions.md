## Highlights
***

> By the fifth time someone has made the same point at you, it's much harder to stay polite, and by the hundredth message it doesn't really matter if the observation is novel you just want these people to shut up and leave you alone.
> You can try getting cranky at them, and indeed it will probably be incredibly hard work not to get cranky at them, but fundamentally it doesn't work because the only reason crankiness can be a useful strategy is when other people notice it before you have to get cranky at them and modify their behaviour accordingly, and if the people doing this were actually paying attention to others' behaviour they wouldn't be repeating the same points you've already heard a dozen time.
> This is an example of an asymmetric cost - although the cost of the interaction is about the same for you and the other party, when you are interacting with many people, the cost of their behaviour on you is effectively much larger than any cost you can impose on them, because they only have to pay it once, while you have to pay it once for each of them. The cost of the interaction is effectively multiplied by the number of people you have to have it with, which for you is large and for them is you.

> The problem with these sorts of asymmetric costs is that, like the Twitter thing, they're almost by definition invisible to those who impose them on you, because if they were there during That Conversation, even if it was initiated with someone else, they wouldn't have to have it again.

> This comes up in more serious conversations too. Vegetarians are often tired of having a conversation justifying their vegetarianism, people are often tired of having a conversation justifying their religion or lack thereof. Coming out as queer, poly, trans, etc. is something you end up doing over and over again, and for most people it's tiring and scary every time.

***

> I don't think all that's going on here is a failure of understanding, but I do think it starts with a failure of understanding. People hear preferences and round them out to someone just making a fuss, because they can't internalise what an extremely big deal that preference is for the other person.

***

> This happens with more reasonable preferences too - to continue the vegetarianism example, there's a lot of work that goes in to persuading people to respect your dietary preferences. Virtually everyone who has such preferences have stories of them being argued with or ignored (often covertly! Many people think it's perfectly reasonable to e.g. sneak butter into something that they serve to someone who has said they can't eat dairy. This is a really bad idea, but distressingly common).
