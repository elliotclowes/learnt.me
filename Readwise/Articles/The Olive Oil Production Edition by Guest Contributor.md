> A dirty secret of the industry is that the amount of extra virgin olive oil produced in the world is less than the amount consumed. The big brands make “more” EVOO by diluting it. The magic number is 0.8%—that’s the maximum amount of free fatty acid (FFA) content an olive oil can have to be extra virgin. Brands will blend 250ml of an excellent EVOO of 0.2% FFA with 750ml of an oil of 1% FFA—a much cheaper “virgin” grade: hey presto! One liter of EVOO with a 0.79% FFA!
> This practice is likely to increase, but it’s not technically illegal. Though real fraud is likely to increase, too, such as the full substitution of EVOO by virgin and refined grades. A few years ago, some popular EVOOs sold in Germany turned out to have been diluted with paraffin. The industry has improved recently as the supply of EVOO has increased, but its knowledge of how to adulterate olive oil (and get away with it) has remained.
