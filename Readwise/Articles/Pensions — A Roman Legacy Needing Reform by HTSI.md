> Those Roman soldiers and the 13 years of salary? The concept was part of the beginning of the end for Rome. When Septimius Severus was dying in 211AD he instructed his son to be sure that he took good care of the army: “Be harmonious, enrich the soldiers and scorn all other men.”
> His son Caracalla, did just that: he increased army salaries by 50 per cent and increased the lump sum they got on retirement by 66 per cent, from 3000 to 5000 denarii, despite the fact that there had not been much in the way of inflation for 200 years.
> This, as economic historian George Maher points out, added the equivalent of some £8bn to the annual bill for the army — and led directly to the debasement of Rome’s once super-stable currency and contributed to the eventual failure of the state. We must be careful with our bribes — something the current crop of would-be prime ministers might like to bear in mind. ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1523751064/20149733))
