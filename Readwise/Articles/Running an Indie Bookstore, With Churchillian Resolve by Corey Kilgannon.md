## Highlights
***

> Churchill died in 1965 at age 90, leaving an output of more than 40 titles and volumes that have been reprinted in some 8,000 different editions by now.
> There are also roughly 800 books about Churchill, said Mr. Singer, who added that he’s had a copy of all of them in the store at some point. His inventory ranges from a $10 paperback of “Churchill on Europe” to a 1906 first-edition softcover of “For Free Trade,” written by the man himself, and stored in a safe at the shop. It goes for a “negotiable” $185,000, Mr. Singer said. ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1242979060/11558102))

> The shop has hung on as one of the last independent bookstores in Midtown Manhattan partly because of Mr. Singer’s own Churchillian tenaciousness, and also because the skyscraper’s owners, the Fisher Brothers, have long extended a “favorable” financial arrangement to Mr. Singer, he said.
> “They have a certain affection for the shop,” said Mr. Singer, who, throughout the years, has certainly leveraged the spell that Churchill casts over certain rich and powerful men who admire his resolve and leadership. ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1242979060/11558104))

> For example, following the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani bought copies of John Lukacs’ “Five Days in London: May, 1940” to lean on, Mr. Singer said. ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1242979060/11558105))

> Caspar Weinberger, while serving as secretary of defense under President Ronald Reagan, bought a pile of books and told Mr. Singer to send the bill to the Pentagon, Mr. Singer said. ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1242979060/11558107))

> Sales in the early days were slow, so Mr. Singer began printing up weekly newsletters highlighing various hardcovers, and sending them to the high-powered finance firms in the building. One week, he mentioned a few Churchill books he had acquired, which caught the eye of the financier Saul Steinberg, the corporate raider.
> Mr. Steinberg’s secretary called down to Mr. Singer requesting “a complete set of everything Churchill ever wrote, first edition and bound in leather,” Mr. Singer said.
> “I asked if he’d like an estimate on that, and she said, ‘No just do it as soon as possible,” said Mr. Singer, who figured out around this time that perhaps he should streamline his inventory. Mr. Singer spent several years traveling to England. He scoured bookstores and “learned about Churchill on the fly,” he said.
> Mr. Singer wound up charging Mr. Steinberg $100,000 for the set, half of which was for a rare copy of Churchill’s “Mr. Brodrick’s Army.”
> “He got a bargain — it’s worth more now,” said Mr. Singer, who after his first year open, switched to a Churchill theme.
> Mr. Steinberg kept the set in his 34-room Park Avenue triplex and held on to it for emotional support, Mr. Singer said, even when his losses forced him to sell off many other assets.
> Mr. Singer reappeared from his office with a Churchill coffee mug, his personal keepsake, grabbed from his desk.
> “I have one for you,” he told the executive on the phone, a regular customer. “On the house.” ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1242979060/11558112))
