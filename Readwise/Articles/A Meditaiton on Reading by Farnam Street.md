> But reading good works is not enough. We must re-read important works immediately because it aids our understanding, a concept that [Mortimer Adler echoes](https://fs.blog/how-to-read-a-book/).
> > Any kind of important book should immediately be read twice, partly because one grasps the matter in its entirety the second time, and only really understands the beginning when the end is known; and partly because in reading it the second time oneâ€™s temper and mood are different, so that one gets another impression; it may be that one sees the matter in another light.
