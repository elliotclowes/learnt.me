> The way Swensen made his returns is also revolutionising the fund management industry.
> Only 4 per cent is in fixed income. And only 27 per cent is in public equities.
> All the rest is in alternative assets – which are not readily marketable – 25 per cent is in “absolute return” hedge funds, which attempt to generate returns uncorrelated to the market, 17 per cent is in private equity, and 27 per cent in “real assets” – property, oil fields and forestry.
