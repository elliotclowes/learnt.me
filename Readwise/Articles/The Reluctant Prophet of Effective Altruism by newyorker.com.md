> The philosopher William MacAskill credits his personal transfiguration to an undergraduate seminar at Cambridge. Before this shift, MacAskill liked to drink too many pints of beer and frolic about in the nude, climbing pitched roofs by night for the life-affirming flush; he was the saxophonist in a campus funk band that played the May Balls, and was known as a hopeless romantic. But at eighteen, when he was first exposed to “Famine, Affluence, and Morality,” a 1972 essay by the radical utilitarian Peter Singer, MacAskill felt a slight click as he was shunted onto a track of rigorous and uncompromising moralism. Singer, prompted by widespread and eradicable hunger in what’s now Bangladesh, proposed a simple thought experiment: if you stroll by a child drowning in a shallow pond, presumably you don’t worry too much about soiling your clothes before you wade in to help; given the irrelevance of the child’s location—in an actual pond nearby or in a metaphorical pond six thousand miles away—devoting resources to superfluous goods is tantamount to allowing a child to drown for the sake of a dry cleaner’s bill. For about four decades, Singer’s essay was assigned predominantly as a philosophical exercise: his moral theory was so onerous that it had to rest on a shaky foundation, and bright students were instructed to identify the flaws that might absolve us of its demands. MacAskill, however, could find nothing wrong with it.
> By the time MacAskill was a graduate student in philosophy, at Oxford, Singer’s insight had become the organizing principle of his life. When he met friends at the pub, he ordered only a glass of water, which he then refilled with a can of two-per-cent lager he’d bought on the corner; for dinner, he ate bread he’d baked at home. The balance of his earnings was reserved for others. He tried not to be too showy or evangelical, but neither was he diffident about his rationale. It was a period in his life both darkly lonesome and ethically ablaze. As he put it to me recently, “I was very annoying.” ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1528544625/20344025))

> MacAskill limits his personal budget to about twenty-six thousand pounds a year, and gives everything else away. He lives with two roommates in a stolid row house in an area of south Oxford bereft, he warned me, of even a good coffee shop. ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1528544625/20344045))

> He surveyed working philosophers and found that none felt like they’d done anything of real consequence. George Marshall, a friend from Cambridge, told me, “He was at dinner in Oxford—some sort of practical-ethics conference—and he was just deeply shocked that almost none of the attendees were vegetarians, because he thought that was the most basic application of ethical ideas.” ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1528544625/20344066))

> When MacAskill was twenty-two, his adviser suggested that he meet an Australian philosopher named Toby Ord. In activist circles, MacAskill had found, “there was this focus on the problems—climate is so bad!—along with intense feelings of angst, and a lack of real views on what one could actually do. But Toby was planning to give money in relatively large amounts to focussed places, and trying to get others to do the same—I felt, ‘Oh, this is taking action.’ ” At the time, Ord was earning fifteen thousand pounds a year and was prepared to give away a quarter of it. “He’d only had two half-pints in his time at Oxford,” MacAskill said. “It was really hardcore.” Unlike, say, someone who donates to cystic-fibrosis research because a friend suffers from the disease—to take a personal example of my own—Ord thought it was important that he make his allocations impartially. There was no point in giving to anyone in the developed world; the difference you could make elsewhere was at least two orders of magnitude greater. Ord’s ideal beneficiary was the Fred Hollows Foundation, which treats blindness in poor countries for as little as twenty-five dollars a person.

> He recalled the pleasure of proving that his new mentor’s donations were suboptimal. “My first big win was convincing him about deworming charities.” It may seem impossible to compare the eradication of blindness with the elimination of intestinal parasites, but health economists had developed rough methods. MacAskill estimated that the relief of intestinal parasites, when measured in “quality-adjusted life years,” or QALYs, would be a hundred times more cost-effective than a sight-saving eye operation. Ord reallocated. ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1528544625/20344260))

> When MacAskill took his vow of relative poverty, he worried that it would make him less attractive to date: “It was all so weird and unusual that I thought, Out of all the people I could be in a relationship with, I’ve just cut out ninety-nine per cent of them.” This prediction was incorrect; in 2013, he married another Scottish philosopher and early E.A., and the two of them took her grandmother’s surname, MacAskill.

> His advice, which became known as “earning to give,” was that you—and the “you” was pretty explicitly high-calibre students at élite institutions—could become a doctor in a poor country and possibly save the equivalent of a hundred and forty lives in your medical career, or you could take a job in finance or consulting and, by donating intelligently, save ten times as many.

> Matt Wage, a student of Singer’s at Princeton, decided that, instead of pursuing philosophy in grad school, he would get a job at the trading firm Jane Street. If you rescued a dozen people from a burning building, he thought, you would live out the rest of your days feeling like a hero; with donations, you could save that many lives every year. “You can pay to provide and train a guide dog for a blind American, which costs about $40,000,” Wage told the reporter Dylan Matthews, for a Washington Post piece called “Join Wall Street. Save the world.” “But with that money you could also cure between 400 and 2,000 people in developing countries of blindness from glaucoma.” ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1528544625/20344341))
