## Highlights
***

> **Inversion:** Avoiding stupidity is easier than trying to be brilliant. Instead of asking, “How can I help my company?” you should ask, “What’s hurting my company the most and how can I avoid it?” Identify obvious failure points, and steer clear of them.

***

> **Mimetic Theory of Desire:** Humans are like sheep. We don’t know what we want, so we imitate each other. Instead of creating our own desires, we desire the same things as other people. The entire advertising industry is built on this idea. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gy7zp0hmekg5pz7dya4mttqw))

***

> **The Never-Ending Now:** The structure of our social media feeds blinds us to history, as it causes us to live in an endless cycle of ephemeral content consumption. The structure of the Internet pulls people away from age-old wisdom. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gy7zqapx38j8e45kwhnp8s5y))

***

> **Opportunity Cost:** By reading this tweet, you are choosing not to read something else. Everything we do is like this. Doing one thing requires giving up another. Whenever you explicitly choose to do one thing, you implicitly choose not to do another thing. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gy7zrpytv9rxwv7c6dw6neny))

***

> **Bike-Shed Effect:** A group of people working on a project will fight over the most trivial ideas. They’ll ignore what’s complicated. They’ll focus too much on easy-to-understand ideas at the expense of important, but hard to talk about ideas. For example, instead of approving plans for a complicated spaceship, the team would argue over the color of the astronaut’s uniforms.

***

> **Gall’s Law:** A complex system that works is invariably found to have evolved from a simple system that worked. A complex system designed from scratch never works and cannot be patched up to make it work. You have to start over with a working simple system.

***

> **Hormesis:** A low dose of something can have the opposite effect of a high dose. A little bit of stress wakes you up, but a lot of stress is bad for you. Lifting weights for 30 minutes per day is good for you, but lifting weights for 6 hours per day will destroy your muscles. Stress yourself, but not too much.

***

> **Circle of Competence:** Define the limits of your knowledge. Hint: the limits are smaller than you think. That’s because being an expert in one area doesn’t make you an expert in anything else. Be clear about what you know and don’t know. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gy800h8xhyrvra8e8rc2wmqx))

***

> **Via Negativa:** When we have a problem, our natural instinct is to add a new habit or purchase a fix. But sometimes, you can improve your life by taking things away. For example, the foods you avoid are more important than the foods you eat. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gy801xd7fy3hdwrjmsf9vqcg))

***

> **Resource Curse:** Countries with an abundance of natural resources such as diamonds and fossil fuels tend to have less economic growth and worse development than countries with fewer natural resources. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gy802b629pp5tqw1jp576j55))

***

> **Baker’s Dozen:** The key to good hospitality is to delight your guests with an unexpected gift. If you run a hotel, leave a chocolate on the bed. If you run a bakery, give your customers one extra bagel. If you write a tweetstorm, share an extra idea. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gy80324ew30yxqr21sz4wd05))
