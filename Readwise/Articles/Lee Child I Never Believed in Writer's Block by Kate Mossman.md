> People are obsessed with the way a novelist such as Child produces his books with mechanical regularity. He once asked a psychiatrist to explain this fascination and the psychiatrist replied that hearing about other people’s routines gives would-be writers licence to fail. We know he spends six months on each, works from noon till six, drinks up to thirty cups of coffee a day, smokes 20 Camels, and fires up a big doob to read over his first drafts while stretching out on a nine-foot sofa. But few would imagine designing a huge steam-punk cover for his extension lead to be part of his creative process; and no one really knows why Child, who is 6ft 4in and fell to just over nine stone during the pandemic, doesn’t eat when he’s working — why he gets off on the feeling of hunger.
