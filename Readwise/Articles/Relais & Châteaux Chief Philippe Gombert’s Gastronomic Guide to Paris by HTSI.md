## Highlights
***

> To experience Paris like a true Parisian, let’s start early in the morning with a walk in the sumptuous gardens of the Palais-Royal. Here, under beautiful arcades, we’ll discover Le Grand Véfour, one of the oldest restaurant in Paris, where you should aim to have lunch or dinner while in the city. Upon entering, you can admire its traditional woodwork and delicate paintings. Choose a table once occupied by Napoleon, Victor Hugo or, more recently, by Colette or Jean Cocteau — a plaque indicates their places. One of the best dishes to eat here is the oxtail parmentier with a delicious truffle purée. ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1496157042/19205907))

> Nearby, you’ll find the Louvre museum. While waiting for it to open, have breakfast on the terrace of the Le Nemours (I always order the buttered toast with an organic fruit juice). ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1496157042/19205908))

> If you prefer to skip lunch to stroll around Paris, you will be peckish by tea time. I suggest you remedy this at Angelina on Rue de Rivoli, a Parisian institution that is almost 120 years old. Savour its famous Mont-Blanc pâtisserie and unforgettable hot chocolate. You won’t feel hungry again until dinner time. ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1496157042/19205910))

> Here you’ll discover Le Saint James hotel, where you can experience one of the most beautiful bars in the city, installed in the former library of this majestic 19th-century residence built by the Thiers family. ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1496157042/19205911))

> Alternatively, treat yourself to a stunning view with an equally delightful gourmand experience at Jules Verne, chef Frédéric Anton’s breathtaking restaurant on the second floor of the Eiffel Tower. The tower was built for the 1889 Universal Exhibition (and only intended to stand for 20 years) and seeing it up close 130 years later, with lift cables and all, is a fascinating spectacle. Jules Verne is one of the few restaurants in Paris where patrons still dress up for dinner. It is a visual and culinary feast — and well worth the visit.
