## Highlights

> In issuing these instructions, Churchill explicitly prioritized the survival of Europeans over that of Indians, extracting thousands of tons of grain from Bengal to both feed British soldiers and aid a parallel famine taking place in Greece. As even the sycophantic Churchill Project of Hillsdale College is forced to admit, he openly said that “the starvation of anyhow underfed Bengalis is less serious than that of sturdy Greeks,” a statement which can hardly be read as anything but homicidally racist. (Consider, here, the cultural connotations: the Greeks were associated with the much-fetishized Classics that formed the backbone of British elite education, while Indians were still seen as the “miserable and brutal creatures” of Churchill’s army days.) Later, when it looked as if Imperial Japan might capture Bengal, a second motivation was added to Churchill’s calculus, and his policy became one of “Denial,” stripping the countryside of any resources it could provide to prevent the Japanese from using them. According to Ali’s figures, 43,000 fishing boats were seized or destroyed, and a further 123,000 tons of rice carted away, leaving little or nothing for Bengalis to subsist on. People became displaced from their homes, overwhelming hospitals as they moved en masse; they sold everything they owned for a few bowls of food, became prey to extortionate money-lenders, and resorted to theft and even cannibalism simply to survive. It is impossible to truly imagine the hell that British policy unleashed on East India, but Ali’s account brings the reader as close as possible—and lays the mountains of corpses squarely at Churchill’s door.

> In an interview with the Times of London, the widow of one prisoner recounts the abuses he suffered at the hands of his British captors:
> The African warders were instructed by the white soldiers to whip him every morning and evening till he confessed […] He said they would sometimes squeeze his testicles with parallel metallic rods. They also pierced his nails and buttocks with a sharp pin, with his hands and legs tied together with his head facing down […] That was the time we realised that the British were actually not friends but, instead, enemies.
> And even this harrowing story might have been forgotten—if the tortured man’s name was not Hussein Onyango Obama, and his grandson was not the President of the United States. No stranger to war crimes himself, Barack Obama removed a large bust of Churchill from the Oval Office as one of his first acts in power—only to be reprimanded, with stunning callousness, by Boris Johnson for the “snub to Britain.” Apparently, even the suffering of one’s direct relatives does not permit any sacrilege against Churchill’s graven image.
