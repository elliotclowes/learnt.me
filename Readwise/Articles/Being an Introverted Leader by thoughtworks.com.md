## Highlights
***

> I once had training on negotiation techniques from a well-known business school. The teacher said a great strategy to extract information from extroverts is to stop talking and create silence. Oftentimes they will start talking without thinking just to fill the space. This does not work on introverts :) ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1554724277/21313930))

> As an introvert, you are likely a good listener, which can lead to practicing empathy if you want. You are also probably good at systemic thinking, analytical thinking, finding patterns, and connecting dots. Maybe you will not be the one who shines and steals the stage in a big group. But on the other hand, you are probably quite good at connecting in a 1:1 closer conversation. Discover what works for you and use it.

> We, introverts, need to analyze lots of things. So if we prepare in advance, read about the topic, have some questions available beforehand, etc., we do way better. Depending on the event, I even visit the facilities before to get to know the place. You will call me crazy, but sometimes I even have escape routes.
