## Highlights
***

> Some clients are low-paid Capitol Hill staffers whose parents, the matchmakers theorize, likely spring for the service. ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1516776865/19923318))

> These power players might be able to mint money and impeach presidents, but D.C.’s matchmakers report that, in love, the elite are as hapless as the masses, and in some ways even more so: Necessarily concerned with privacy and discretion, many won’t risk exposure by setting up profiles on Bumble or Hinge; traveling constantly for work or employed in high-security-clearance jobs (e.g. CIA, Pentagon) where they are separated all day from their personal devices, they’re hardly available for the swiping and text-flirting required to stay in the game; judged prematurely by paramours they meet in the wild who recognize them from TV, they rarely get an honest chance to make a first impression.
> And: At ease in positions of authority and practiced in the art of the no-comment comment, these Washingtonians aren’t exactly comfortable being vulnerable and open — which is to say, their dating acumen can trail way behind their professional prowess.
> “People like this, especially in D.C., they’re used to getting what they want,” said Woodward Pu. “They can work harder or smarter or get a connection for it. And this is the one place they have not been able to figure out. It’s very vexing for them, and it’s very vulnerable. People are coming to us with a level of vulnerability that they’ve probably never experienced or shown ever.” ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1516776865/19923324))

> Some clients, though, do come to matchmakers with very, very specific asks. One VIP TDR client requested his matchmaker set him up with Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez — a move that perfectly illustrates the hilarious and infuriating paradox of the straight male dater: devoted enough to his would-be girlfriend to drop thousands of dollars on a matchmaking service, but apparently incapable of Googling “AOC + boyfriend?” to find out that she’s been in a serious, long-term relationship since well before she ran for office.
> “Oftentimes in D.C. guys will say, ‘this reporter, this news anchor, this woman is my dream woman,’ and we can go track her down to find her,” said Kat Markiewicz, a D.C. matchmaker who grew up in the District. TDR matchmakers will do “the dirty detective work,” as Markiewicz puts it, of sliding into a star’s DMs on their client’s behalf; TDR policy is to “always reach out to anyone [a client] is interested in,” said Talia Goldstein, founder of TDR.
> Some D.C. men ask after celebrities who don’t live here (Chelsea Handler) or who not only don’t live here but are also married and definitely out of their league (Margot Robbie). Laricks says her gay clients seeking men bring up actor Matt Bomer a lot — not literally Matt Bomer, though, just someone who looks like him.

> What’s funny to the matchmakers is how often these wish lists fail to produce the match their clients desire. “It’s through a lot of conversations and setting them up on dates with people who went to Harvard and are six feet tall — and then they go out, and it’s an OK date, but it doesn’t work out,” said Bernstein, that clients learn to keep a more open mind. “People get so focused on what they think they need, or what society tells them they need for a ‘successful’ relationship, they lose a bit of their own identity.” ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1516776865/19923341))
