## Highlights
***

> By mass-marketing social aspiration, the brand toed the line between exclusivity and accessibility—and established prep as America’s visual vernacular.
> Duck boots, barn coats, and turtleneck sweaters seemed deeply eccentric in the sunny, laid-back suburb of Silicon Valley where I grew up, in the eighties and nineties. These garments—among the talismanic offerings of the J. Crew catalogue that somehow appeared in the mailbox—might as well have been for wearing on Mars, and my friends and I, many of us the children of immigrants, were only dimly aware of the heritage that they were inviting us to access. (I had no idea that a person could be called a Wasp, other than the Wasp in my comic books.) But we knew that J. Crew was, enticingly, just out of our reach. And, because these clothes communicated in an insider’s code, lacking the self-identifying mark of a little swoosh or a tiny guy on a horse, they seemed mysterious, too.
> I picked out the most unusual item I could find: an unlined, plaid zip-up jacket. When it arrived, it clashed with my middle-school wardrobe, a mix of basketball sneakers, my father’s old corduroys, and skate-themed T-shirts. I didn’t understand that my new jacket was something one might wear to go boating, or even that people went boating for fun. Yet I delighted in wearing it along with my normal clothes, creating a garish mishmash of stolen subcultural valor. The look was awful, and it was mine.
> It was also, in part, Arthur Cinader’s. When Cinader started J. Crew, as a mail-order retailer, in 1983, he was targeting shoppers who wanted something more stylish than other mail-order brands, such as L. L. Bean or Lands’ End, and more affordable than Ralph Lauren. But, where traditional catalogues highlighted the product, J. Crew’s emphasized scenes, tableaux, glimpses of leisurely cool. The pages featured the upper crust at play, horsing around and lounging about, untroubled yet serious. These were poses and postures to be studied and adopted, and here were the anoraks, chambray shirts, or roll-neck sweaters to wear while doing so. Soon after the first J. Crew catalogues were sent out, telephone operators struggled to keep up with all the calls. “You looked at the catalogue and thought, ‘I want to live like that,’ ” the designer Peter Som explained.

> Within half a dozen years, the brand had become synonymous with preppy apparel, and Cinader decided to open its first brick-and-mortar shop—a potentially risky move for a business based on a meticulously conceived catalogue. But he and his colleagues enlisted catalogue data to make decisions about location. The first J. Crew store was in Manhattan’s South Street Seaport, a tourist zone that also happened to be close enough to Wall Street to catch the after-work crowd. The night of the grand opening, a fire marshal was said to have shown up because of reports of overcrowding. When J. Crew expanded to Boston, Cinader and his colleagues targeted the Chestnut Hill Mall, an accessible distance to at least a dozen colleges. “We never meet a college student who doesn’t know J. Crew very well,” Cinader said. By the mid-nineties, J. Crew, still a family-run business, was opening stores across the country and sending out seventy million catalogues a year. More important, it was permeating culture—competitors imitated its catalogues, and, where it had once positioned itself as an affordable alternative to Ralph Lauren, upstart brands now offered themselves as down-market alternatives to J. Crew.
> All of them were trying to replicate the potent yet amorphous sensibility that had captivated Cinader: prep, which the author Maggie Bullock describes as “the bedrock of straightforward, unfettered, ‘American’ style.” Her new book, “[The Kingdom of Prep: The Inside Story of the Rise and (Near) Fall of J. Crew](https://www.amazon.com/Kingdom-Prep-Inside-Story-J-Crew/dp/0063042649/ref=sr_1_1?crid=31RICO24FIK17&keywords=%22The%20Kingdom%20of%20Prep:%20The%20Inside%20Story%20of%20the%20Rise%20and%20%28Near%29%20Fall%20of%20J.%20Crew%22&qid=1679325853&s=books&sprefix=the%20kingdom%20of%20prep%20the%20inside%20story%20of%20the%20rise%20and%20near%20fall%20of%20j.%20crew%20,stripbooks,86&sr=1-1)” (HarperCollins), is a buoyant and persuasive account of how the company’s fluctuating fortunes reflect Americans’ shifting attitudes toward dress, shopping, and identity.
> At the center of Bullock’s story is the malleability of prep, which she depicts as the “leisure uniform of the establishment.” What people consider to be cool changes with time, but coolness always presumes exclusivity and effortlessness. At its height, Bullock argues, J. Crew embodied the nonchalant, “broken-in cool” that typified prep. What’s complicated about the mass-marketing of social aspiration, though, is that it’s more about belonging to a group than about standing out as an individual. The class fantasy at the heart of prep style was the prep school, where dress codes offered a way of diminishing the differences among its students. This was a different temperature of cool from, say, the leather jacket. With the rise of prep fashion, you could dress up like members of the ruling class, even if the looks you mimicked were solely of them dressing down.
> “Prep” didn’t start out as an aspirational identity. The term gained wide currency with “Love Story,” the 1970 blockbuster film about a working-class Radcliffe student (Ali MacGraw), who falls in love with a Harvard blue blood (Ryan O’Neal). She calls him a “preppy” to tease him, but eventually it becomes a term of affection. For many, the expression brought into focus an entire history of Northeastern prep-school privilege, a style associated with Wasp culture. In 1980, Lisa Birnbach’s “[The Official Preppy Handbook](https://www.amazon.com/Official-Preppy-Handbook-Lisa-Birnbach/dp/0894801406/ref=sr_1_1?crid=78D2Q7I7IJ10&keywords=the%20official%20preppy%20handbook%20by%20lisa%20birnbach&qid=1679326033&s=books&sprefix=The%20Official%20Preppy%20Handbook%20b,stripbooks,77&sr=1-1)” was published, as a tongue-in-cheek guide to the fashions, speech patterns, and codes of high society. It was satire, but no offense was taken. As Bullock writes, “Rich kids love poking fun at their own privilege, so long as they don’t lose any of it in the process.” And, for those who aspired to join their ranks, the best-selling book offered a script for acting the part.
> Prep fashion has its roots in the nineteenth century. In 1849, Brooks Brothers introduced the ready-to-wear suit to American consumers, radically changing how people dressed. The availability of premade garments in standardized sizes had two effects: it made “gentlemanly” dress affordable to everyday workers, and it loosened the silhouette of menswear from the fitted, custom tailoring of the Victorian era.
> Bullock argues that Brooks Brothers’ roots could be construed as “deeply egalitarian”—the firm sought to outfit the common worker. Yet by the early twentieth century its clothing had become identified with élite boarding schools and the Ivy League institutions that they fed. In F. Scott Fitzgerald’s “[This Side of Paradise](https://www.amazon.com/This-Side-Paradise-Warbler-Classics/dp/1735515175/ref=tmm_pap_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&qid=1679326111&sr=1-3-spons),” partly set at Princeton during the nineteen-tens, the undergraduate poet Tom D’Invilliers laments how dress became a competition, with his classmates keenly attentive to details like “the color of their neckties and the roll of their coats.” Even during the Great Depression, Ivy League campuses were a laboratory for leisure-wear experimentation: penny loafers and bucks, varsity sweaters, banded V-neck sweaters, all assembled with the nonchalance of true Wasp privilege. “Nothing identified an outsider like a too-crisp collar or a spit-shined brogue,” Bullock writes. “A ma ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gwrv9435hga2s7ewz31knvzh))
