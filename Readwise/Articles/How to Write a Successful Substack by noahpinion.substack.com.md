> I should note, by the way, that advice is probably overrated. The reason is that people don’t really know how they accomplished what they accomplished. They know the things they did, and they know the results they achieved, but because they’ve only done it one time, they don’t really know which exact things were effective and which were just incidental or even detrimental to their success.

He would be able to tell you how he did it, but that exact method wouldn’t work in 2022 even if he tried to do it again. If Mike started again at age 22 today, with $0, what are the chances he’d make tens of billions of dollars? We just don’t know. What we do know is that aping rich people usually won’t make you rich. And this is probably the same with any goal, including writing a popular blog/newsletter. ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1520684172/20027770))
