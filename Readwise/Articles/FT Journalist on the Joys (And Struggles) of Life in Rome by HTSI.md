## Highlights

> On weekends, we mainly head to the two large parks close to us. For an ancient city, Rome is very green. One of our favourite destinations is Villa Borghese, an elegantly groomed park above the Spanish steps, which even has a well-maintained zoo (the lemurs are our favourites). The other is Villa Ada, a large park with grassy meadows surrounded by tall stone pines, a classic of Roman vegetation: it includes small lakes, a café, a horse stable and, rather bizarrely, the Egyptian embassy.

> Sometimes, though, we just want to take off to the countryside. Often it is to Fabrica di Roma, a small town surrounded by hazelnut trees in the province of Viterbo, about 40 miles north of the capital, where my father’s family is from. Another favourite day trip is to Sperlonga, a town about two hours’ drive south of Rome, perched on a hill overlooking a beautiful sandy beach.

> Take a day trip to Bomarzo to visit the Sacro Bosco (Sacred Wood). This sculpture park, designed in the 16th century, features giant turtles, crooked houses and massive trolls. Afterwards, go to local restaurant Piccolo Mondo for some of the best homemade ravioli in Italy ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1496161168/19205898))
