> Harry Truman – a failed retailer, failed farmer, failed zinc miner, failed oil driller, and senator held on leash by local Missouri businessmen – was almost universally panned when he became President after Franklin Roosevelt died. The Washington Post wrote: “We should be less than candid at this grave moment if we did not recognize the great disparity between Mr. Truman’s experience and the responsibilities that have been thrust upon him.” Historian David McCoullough wrote: “To many it was not just that the greatest of men had fallen, but that the least of men— or at any rate the least likely of men— had assumed his place.” Today, Truman is consistently ranked among historians’ top-10 presidents of all time, often ahead of Roosevelt.

> Asked, “You seem extremely happy and content. What’s your secret to living a happy life?” 98-year-old Charlie Munger recently replied:
> The first rule of a happy life is low expectations. If you have unrealistic expectations you’re going to be miserable your whole life. You want to have reasonable expectations and take life’s results good and bad as they happen with a certain amount of stoicism. ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1554725567/21313962))

> My friend Brent has a related theory about marriage: It only works when both people want to help their spouse while expecting nothing in return. If you both do that, you’re both pleasantly surprised. ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1554725567/21313964))

> One, the realization that most good outcomes come from a minority of the actions you take, so it’s normal if most of what you do doesn’t work out. Failing nine times and having a big win on the tenth attempt is about as good as it gets in a lot of things – investments, relationships, careers, etc. When you accept that losing often is the only path to winning occasionally, it’s easier to keep your expectations low without losing ambition and motivation.
