## Highlights
***

> o in the summer of 2020, I stopped. I swore to only read the news on Saturday mornings. Since then, I’ve given it up almost entirely.
> And I feel better. Way, way better. It feels like a war that used to be fought in my backyard is now being fought on Neptune instead. ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1522968380/20180001))

> Media types will own up to this when nobody’s looking. I was once at a dinner with an editor at a big-name news organization, and after he put back a few drinks, he looked around at us, wild-eyed. “Some people think we’re, like, doing public service,” he said. “We’re not. This is entertainment for people who want to feel smart.” ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1522968380/20180077))

> “If you don’t read the news you’ll be left out of conversations.”
> That’s fine by me, because those conversations are usually like:
> “Did you hear about this outrageous thing?”
> “Yes!”
> “It’s so outrageous!”
> “It is!”
> “I’m mad about it!”
> “Me too!”
> “It’s just like them, to be so outrageous!”
> “What do you expect!”
> “These times, huh?”
> “Tell me about it.”
> These conversations make me uncomfortable because if we were really so outraged, we should be doing something about it, rather than just talking about it. ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1522968380/20180087))

> You should read the news and feel bad! The world is full of suffering and you should pay attention to it!”
> I used to gulp down articles about genocide, pestilence, and hunger—and do precisely nothing about them. That’s voyeurism, not virtue. If I actually want to empathize with people who are suffering, I should read something written by them, or at least something written with care and depth, not something simply fired off to feed the 24-hour titillation machine.
> But I agree with this argument’s sentiment: the world is full of bad things and you should do something about them. The news is just a bad way of figuring out what the bad things are and what to do about them. I am a son, a brother, an uncle, a partner, and a friend; I make my living teaching students and doing research. I actually matter in those small circles, and I understand what the problems are and what to do about them. I can literally change lives by trying to do good in my corner of the world, and reading the news distracts me from that. ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1522968380/20180095))

> Cultivating a garden is all about keeping some stuff out (bunnies, birds, bugs) and keeping other things in (water, fertilizer, sunlight). You can’t grow anything directly; you don’t make sunflowers taller by yanking on their stalks. All you can do is create the right environment and hope the seedlings reach for the sky.
> Cultivating a human mind works the same way. You have to keep some stuff out (lies, noise, fear) and some stuff in (knowledge, experience, love). You can’t grow your mind directly; you don’t get smarter by yanking on your frontal lobe. All you can do is create the right environment and hope your brain-folds get deeper.
> When it comes to mind-gardening, I think the keeping-in comes easy and the keeping-out comes hard. Our ancestors never had more videos than they could ever watch or more books than they could ever read. We, their hapless descendants, are evolutionarily unprepared for a world where we can binge on content until we hurl. We need the mental equivalent of chicken-wire: a barrier to let the sunlight in while keeping the varmints out. For now, that barrier must come from deliberate practice. But perhaps one day it can come from a cultural distaste for the mind-rot of news. ([View Highlight](https://instapaper.com/read/1522968380/20180149))
