> GPT-3 and ChatGPT are both “large language models” (LLMs). These are machine-learning models that can generate natural-sounding text, code, and more. They’re trained using large data sets of text, which helps them master natural-language tasks, like answering questions, writing marketing copy, and holding conversations. So what’s the difference between them? And why is it important?
> GPT-3 is a general-purpose language model: it can hold conversations, write code, complete a blog post, do translation tasks, and more. You can think of it like a flexible know-it-all that can expound on any topic you want.
> ChatGPT is a version of GPT-3 that’s been turned into a friendly, inoffensive extrovert. Basically, it’s been trained to be good at holding conversations. Its creator OpenAI does this by repeatedly holding conversations with the model, and rewarding it for good responses and punishing it for bad ones—a process called [Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback](https://huggingface.co/blog/rlhf).

> **GPT-3 tends to “hallucinate.”** [Hallucination](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hallucination_(artificial_intelligence)) is a technical term that refers to the model’s propensity to return nonsensical or false completions depending on what’s asked of it. The model is like a smart and overeager 6-year-old. It will try its best to give you a good answer even if it doesn’t know what it’s talking about. OpenAI and other foundational-model companies are actively working on this problem, but it’s still common. It’s compounded by the second problem.
