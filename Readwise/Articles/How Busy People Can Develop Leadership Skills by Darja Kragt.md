## Highlights
***

> spend time observing other leaders. Find a leader in your organization who demonstrates behaviors aligned with your areas of development. Observe how and what they do. If you have an opportunity, ask them questions about why they did something, but don’t push — we’re often not aware of our behaviors. Again, don’t just watch. Make notes and think about how you can replicate it. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gwpxqyyy7f3akr3daess3xk5))

> If this still feels overwhelming, remember this: We mistakenly think that leadership development only occurs in the workplace. However, [research](https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2017-29634-005) suggests that most effective leaders learn all the time and everywhere. Being a parent, a community sports player, or a volunteer — all these roles involve an element of leadership. Think about what you can learn about leadership from these roles, conduct behavioral experiments in these other contexts, and reflect on how the learning applies to your work role. I guarantee it will help to accelerate your development as a leader in key areas you have identified. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gwpxtvew1a7qk556w30xck82))
