## Highlights
***

> One crazy stat he mentioned is that globally, the average Instagram user spends 21 minutes on the app per day.

Note: This was way back in 2014. I would imagine the figure is a lot higher now. Although it will depend on the app. Although that is beside the point. It doesn’t matter if it’s Instagram or another one like TikTok or Snapchat or Twitter. People spend a lot of time on these apps!￼
