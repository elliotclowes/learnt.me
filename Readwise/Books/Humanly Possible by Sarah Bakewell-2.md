> Petrarch did leave an affectionate gift to Boccaccio in his will: 'fifty Florentine gold florins for a winter garment to be worn by him while he is studying and working during the night hours’. (Page 62)

***

> Coluccio was also a great collector, with a library of some eight hundred books, enhanced by his own marginal notes and amendments. He lent them to interested readers, and eventually they went to the monastery of San Marco in Florence. He also advanced the study of Greek in Florence, by inviting the scholar Manuel Chrysoloras from Constantinople to teach it - beginning a great flourishing of Greek studies in Italy and putting Petrarch's and Boccaccio's struggles with the language firmly in the past. (Page 63)

> In truth, you didn't need classical literature to learn vices: according to a dialogue on hypocrisy by Poggio, one preacher often provided so much detail in his sermons against lust that the congregation rushed home afterwards to try out the practices for themselves. (Page 99)

***

> Meanwhile, one also has to ask: could such a multi-sided, selfdetermining, free, harmonious marvel ever actually exist? How many human chameleons were walking around Florence?
>
> Certainly, if you hoped to find one, Florence was a good place to look. Candidates for models of all-capable humanity who might often be found there included Leonardo da Vinci, the versatile artistic and scientific genius, and the architect Leon Battista Alberti. Those were in fact the two names chosen by the nineteenth-century historian Jacob Burckhardt when he was looking for exemplars of what he considered the era's distinctive figure: the uomo universale, or 'universal man', who could take on any form and achieve almost anything in a fluid, constantly changing society. (Page 106)

***

> Leon Battista Alberti seems an apt choice, too, especially if we read a glowing contemporary account of his achievements written by an anonymous we are now fairly certain was none other than Alberti himself. It portrays him, not without justification, as a man of innumerable facets, capable in every field of life, excelling in every quality except modesty.
>
> He did have a lot to be immodest about. Besides designing buildings and producing pictures, he wrote important treatises on the arts of painting, building, and sculpture. He was an expert surveyor and devised new techniques to produce a study of Rome's ruins. He wrote Latin theatrical comedy about Greek gods, and a book titled Mathematical Games. Each of his fields of expertise enhanced the others, as when he used his mathematical talents to work out rules for creating the illusion of perspective in visual art.
>
> Those achievements are well documented, but the biography goes further. Alberti wrestled, he sang, he pole-vaulted, he climbed mountains. In youth, he was strong enough to throw an apple over the top of a church and to jump over a man's back from a standing start. He was so resistant to pain that, when he wounded his foot at the age of fifteen, he could calmly help a surgeon to stitch it closed.
>
> He cultivated subtler abilities too. By going bareheaded on horseback (an unusual thing to do), he trained himself to endure chills on his head, even in the fierce winds of winter. Applying the same principle to the cold winds of social life, he 'deliberately exposed himself to shameless impudence just to teach himself patience'. He loved talking to everyone he could find, seeking new knowledge. He would invite friends over so that they could talk about literature and philosophy, and to these friends he would also dictate little works while he painted their portrait or made a wax model of one of them'. In every situation, he sought to behave virtuously; 'he wanted everything in his life, every gesture and every word, to be, as well as to seem to be, the expression of one who merits the good will of good men.' At the same time, he valued sprezzatura, adding art to art to make the result seem free of artifice', especially when it came to three important activities: 'how one walks in the street, how one rides, and how one speaks; in these things one should make every effort to be intensely pleasing to all.' Throughout all of this, he 'kept a cheerful manner and even, insofar as dignity permitted, an air of gaiety'.
>
> Alberti was thus the very model of the splendid, accomplished, free human being in the full sunlight of his days. True, he was exceptionally able. But what is being conjured up here is more than that; it is an ideal figure of the human in general. All the qualities highlighted are those of humanitas: intellectual and artistic excellence, moral virtue and fortitude, sociability, good speaking, sprezzatura, being courteously pleasing to all'. Along with this comes his excellent physical condition: the mental abilities were reflected in his physical proportions. Reading his description, one pictures another figure of the time: that of 'Vitruvian Man'. (Page 106)

***

> Vitruvian Man was a perfectly proportioned, steady-gazing, wellformed male figure, whose origin is purely mathematical. He illustrates the ratios of distance that were supposed to exist between parts of the human body: the chin to the roots of the hair, the wrist to the tip of the middle finger, the chest to the crown of the head, and so on. Calculating these ratios in the first century BCE, Vitruvius was interested not so much in anatomical design as in architecture: these proportions of the male body seemed to him the best basis for the shape of a temple. Thus, the human being – as Protagoras would have said - should literally be taken as the measure, or criterion. Vitruvius gave the method for deriving the data. If a man lies on his back with hands and feet spread, and you draw a circle with his navel as the centre, the circumference will touch his fingers and toes. You can also create a square based on the span of his arms and the length of his body, when he brings his feet together.
>
> Artists of the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries did their best to make this Vitruvian ideal come true. Even designers of printing fonts modelled their letters on the Vitruvian body. Michelangelo Buonarroti followed the temple theme by designing a facade for the San Lorenzo church in Florence based on such dimensions - although he never built it, because he could not source the marble he wanted.
>
> Most celebrated was the drawing made around 1490 by Leonardo da Vinci, showing a man in the two positions simultaneously, along with his measures in delicate box shapes. The man is positioned inside a circle centring on his navel, as well as a square. His expression is frowning but serene; he has a fine head of hair, and turns one foot sideways to show how its dimensions fit with the whole. He is perfect - apart from having too many arms and legs.
>
> Leonardo's original drawing sits well guarded in the Gallerie dell'Accademia in Venice, but the disembodied image has traversed a huge sweep of history and geography, representing human confidence, beauty, harmony and strength. It has become an instant icon for the idea of the 'Renaissance', and of 'universal man'; a visual companion to Pico's dignified chameleon. Even the international symbol for the modern humanist movement echoes it: the 'Happy Human' image, designed by Dennis Barrington in 1965, shows a human shape with arms flung up in a similar way, full of confidence, openness and well-being. (Interestingly, Humanists UK has now moved away from this towards a more fluid symbol resembling a dancing piece of string - chosen because it is a figure following its own motion instead of standing before us to be measured. You can see this symbol at the end of the last chapter of this book, at page 368.)
>
> In fact, what distinguishes the Leonardo image from other Vitruvian ones is that it does not submit to symmetrical measurements; its shapes are not concentric. Leonardo achieved the figure's visual beauty and plausibility by displacing the square downwards. The circle centres on the navel, but the square centres somewhere around the base of the man's penis. Also, the upper tips of the square poke through the circle's radius. The proportions had to be tweaked, because even 'ideal' humans are not a precise set of boxes and circles. Many correspondences do exist: the finger-to-finger span of a broad-shouldered man is likely to be more or less the same as his height. But without adjustment, a real Vitruvian man would look mighty weird, as is clear from some other examples, such as the one in a 1521 Italian translation of Vitruvius illustrated by Cesare Cesariano.
>
> The message here is that real human beings, even those who match the dominant template of muscular masculinity, are characterised by something less than perfect harmony. They are subtly off-centre. An ideal, harmonious human cannot be found any more than an ideal, harmonious city can (or even a harmonious chameleon). Immanuel Kant was surely closer to the truth when he wrote, three centuries later: 'Out of such crooked wood as the human being is made, nothing entirely straight can be fabricated. (Page 107)

***

> At last, in 1543, Vesalius produced his masterwork: De humani corporis fabrica, or of the Structure of the Human Body, in which he repudiated the notion of a human rete for once and for all. He blamed both himself and other anatomists for having been too Galen-reliant: 'I shall say nothing more about these others; instead I shall marvel more at my own stupidity and blind faith in the writings of Galen and other anatomists.' He ends the section by urging students to rely on their own careful examinations, taking no one's word for anything, not even his own.
>
> This was a good warning, since Vesalius himself did not get everything right. One error was that he failed to identify the clitoris correctly, misdescribing it as part of the labia. It took another Padua anatomist, Realdo Colombo, to correct him. Realdo even knew what it was for, which implies that he had noticed it in contexts other than the dissection table. He named it 'amor Veneris, vel dulcendo' ('love of Venus, or thing of pleasure'), gave details of its role in women's sexual experiences, and remarked, 'It cannot be said how astonished I am that so many famous anatomists had not even an inkling of such a lovely thing, perfected with such art for the sake of such utility (Page 131)

***

> d'Holbach himself seemed a good example of this liberating effect: he was an irrepressible enthusiast who kept a large collection of natural history specimens for his daytime studies and an equally large collection of fine wines and foods for his evening salon, at which he entertained fellow lumières twice weekly. Among the whole group, he and Diderot were known as the two greatest atheists, although Diderot was more cautious about going fully public. (Page 171)

***

> The humanistic thrust of these ideas had less to do with their theoretical content than with the consequences for ourselves. If prayer and ritual do not matter, and if nothing happens outside the general order of nature, then our lives are entirely human concerns. What we lose in personal attention and miracles, we gain in the benefits of being responsible for our world, and able to improve things if we want to without any comment from above.
>
> The results for ethics are dramatic. If we want to live in a wellregulated, peaceful society, then we must create one and maintain it. Instead of referring moral questions to divine commandments, we must also work out our own system of good, generous, mutually beneficial ethics. We can try to generate our own rules - such as 'do as you would be done by', or 'treat all human beings as an end in themselves, not a means to something else', or 'choose the action that brings the greatest happiness to the greatest number. These are handy tools for moral thinking, but they are not the same as a set of orders literally set in stone tablets by God. Our moral lives remain complex and personal - and human. (Page 173)

***

> In 1819, Richard Carlile was tried for publishing both his own experiences of the Peterloo Massacre (a lethal cavalry attack on protesters at Manchester's St Peter's Fields) and Paine's Age of Reason. To defy the rules on the latter, Carlile tried a clever courtroom trick. He recited the work in its entirety in court as part of his defence, on the basis that it was important for understanding the principles of the case. The plan was that, afterwards, everything said at the trial could be legally published as a transcript the full text of The Age of Reason included. Had that succeeded, it would have gone down in humanist history as one of the best feats of censorship beating ever, but sadly, it did not; no transcript ever appeared. (Page 185)

***

> He (David Hume) had become so easy-going - and had also become that ‘large jolly man' - after having put himself through a sort of therapy to counter too much futile battling with philosophy in his youth. Having cudgelled his brains with unresolvable philosophical puzzles, he fell into a wan state and wrote to a doctor asking for advice. The doctor suggested dropping the philosophy and drinking a pint of claret a day, combined with some gentle horse-riding. Hume tried it and soon became, as he wrote, 'the most sturdy, robust, healthful-like fellow you have seen, with a ruddy complexion and a cheerful countenance'. (Page 189)

***

> David Hume resembled Montaigne in other respects too, notably in his striking combination of the toughest intellectual scepticism with tolerant good humour. One can hear Montaigne's voice, for example, when Hume tells us, at the end of the devastating first book of the Treatise, that its contents have taken him to such a strange place that he now feels like a monster ('Where am I, or what? From what causes do I derive my existence, and to what condition shall I return? Whose favour shall I court, and whose anger must I dread? What beings surround me?') - only to then conclude that there is no cause for concern. Reason may not be able to help him, but Nature promptly cures him of his 'melancholy and delirium' by distracting him with the everyday enjoyments of life. 'I dine, I play a game of back-gammon, I converse, and am merry with my friends.' (Page 190)

***

> John Stuart Mill, in The Subjection of Women, wrote that we simply cannot know what either sex is 'really’ like, because there has never been a society in which women were not influenced by male domination. This distorts women, like hothouse plants made to grow into a particular shape or size. (It distorts men, too.) Meanwhile ‘men, with that inability to recognise their own work which distinguishes the unanalytic mind, indolently believe that the tree grows of itself in the way they have made it grow.' (Page 209)

***

> Yet the amount of thinking required should not be that demanding. The great abolitionist and autobiographer Frederick Douglass put the point with memorable force and clarity in a Fourth of July oration of 1852, saying: "There is not a man beneath the canopy of heaven, that does not know that slavery is wrong for him.' That single line destroys whole volumes of faulty argument - beginning with Aristotle. (Page 209)

***

> As Frederick Douglass puts it elsewhere, in My Bondage and My Freedom, nothing in the human world is the way it is by necessity or by nature. He applies this even to brutal slaveholders, who, he suggests, could have been humane and respectable had their lives had a different context. On a moral and human level, the institution of slavery had destroyed them, too: "The slaveholder, as well as the slave, is the victim of the slave system.' As we saw earlier, Archbishop Desmond Tutu would later say something similar about South African apartheid, and James Baldwin said it too in 1960: 'It is a terrible, an inexorable, law that one cannot deny the humanity of another without diminishing one's own." In general, wrote Douglass, 'a man's character greatly takes its hue and shape from the form and color of things about him’. (Page 211)

***

> The idea for the book had come to him two years earlier when he visited the author Edward Carpenter, who - amazingly - lived openly with his partner, George Merrill. Sharing a home in an idyllic forest setting, they were countercultural vegetarians who chopped their own wood and, in Carpenter's case, wrote books. These books presented the case for women's rights, better education in matters of sexuality, and more acceptance of sexual diversity. In Love's Coming-of-Age, published in 1896 (thus, while Oscar Wilde was still in prison), Carpenter argued for a richer, less fragmented understanding of human life, which would integrate the sexual part of our existence with the rest, rather than treating it as something never to be mentioned. For Carpenter, that exclusion impoverished life. It entailed a 'thinning out of human nature'. It would be much better if sexuality were a subject taught in schools, not just to give information on physical basics, but especially to discuss the more important 'human element in love'.
>
> Carpenter and Merrill welcomed visitors to their happy forest glade, although with exceptions. One door-to-door missionary who asked if they did not want to get to heaven was banished by Merrill with the answer 'Can't you see that we're in heaven here - and we don't want any better than this, so go away’. (Page 215)

> Wilhelm von Humboldt:
>
> > “The more in life one searches for, and finds, human beings, the richer, more self-sufficient, more independent one becomes oneself. More humanized, more readily touched by all that is human in all the facets of one's nature, and in all aspects of creation. This is the goal, dear Li, to which my nature urges me. This is what I live and breathe. Here for me is the final key to all desire... Who, when he dies, can tell himself, 'I have comprehended as much world as I am able, and have transformed it into my humanness,' has fulfilled his aim.” (Page 229)

> Arnoldian thinking does have a certain air of earnestness, which was carried forth during its long afterlife of influence in Britain and elsewhere. It was a force behind the foundation, in the twentieth century, of the British Broadcasting Corporation, which aimed at enlightening and informing as well as entertaining the masses. It lay at the centre of countless institutions of adult education founded earlier in that century, such as the Workers' Educational Association, established in 1903.
>
> It also had an impact on the publishing industry, which had a very Arnoldian phase in America and Britain alike. Sets of 'Great Books' could be good earners for publishers, since Shakespeare and Milton required no royalty payments. Even translations could work well, despite the need for translators. One early series, Bohn's Standard Library, published many Greek and Roman classics in English, although it did frustrate readers by leaving any lines referring to sex in their original languages.
>
> Then came such outstanding productions as Dr Eliot's Five-Foot Shelf of Books, the name bestowed on the fifty-one-volume set of literature edited in 1909 by Charles W. Eliot, the president of Harvard University. In Britain there was the Everyman's Library, founded in 1906 by J. M. Dent, the working-class son of a housepainter. Unfortunately, Dent's own habit of shouting 'You donkey!' at members of his staff on a regular basis suggests that he was not a fan of every man or woman himself. Those employees were, in fact, the secret of the publisher's success, especially the series editor Ernest Rhys, a coal-mining engineer who had run reading groups for miners before shifting to the book world. He gave the series its ethos: the books must be cheap yet designed to the highest standards. Each sported an attractive woodcut title page and the dolphin-and-anchor printer's device of Aldus Manutius - a tribute to that pioneer of clear, well-printed, portable books.
>
> To help readers find their way around such abundance, lists of Arnoldian 'bests' began to appear, such as the 'Best Hundred Books', chosen in 1886 by the director of the Working Men's College, Sir John Lubbock. Besides the usual Eurocentric choices, he recommended such works as Kongzi's Analects and potted versions of the Mahabharata and the Rāmāyana. He did admit that he had not personally enjoyed everything on the list: ‘As regards the Apostolic Fathers, I cannot say that I found their writings either very interesting or instructive, but they are also very short.' (Page 242)

***

> Another noted agnostic of the nineteenth century, Sir Leslie Stephen, was more flippant about his reasons for choosing the term: he said he preferred agnostic because atheist still savoured too much of the stake in this world and hell-fire in the next'. But agnostics could carry a whiff of that destination as well: the educational reformer Frederick James Gould recalled once chatting about the afterlife with an amiable Salvation Army officer over tea and sandwiches: 'I asked him what became of sincere Agnostics. He pointed dramatically to the floor, and calmly munched bread-and-butter and water-cress.
>
> Sir Leslie Stephen was known as the compiler of the very Victorian Dictionary of National Biography; he would also later be remembered as the father of the resolutely non-Victorian experimental novelist Virginia Woolf. He also found time to be a noted mountaineer. One of his Alpine experiences became the basis for an entertaining essay of 1872, A Bad Five Minutes in the Alps'. It sums up his mental tour of possible beliefs, and the conclusions he reached about them, all while telling a literally cliffhanging story.
>
> One Sunday, he says, while staying in one of the mountain resorts there, he went out for a bracing pre-lunch walk. It was windy, and then it started to rain. Trying to return, Stephen took what he thought would be a shortcut. At one point on it, the track seemed to disappear on a stretch of rock face above a torrential stream, before resuming visibly on the other side. He decided to risk it and started scrambling across. At first it was easy, but as he took a large step and reached for an outcrop above him to steady himself, he slipped. As he slid down towards the stream far below, he had time for just one thought, and it was, 'At last!' He had feared and wondered about death for so long; now it was upon him.
>
> But he flung out a hand just in time and managed to grab the ledge his feet had been on, stopping his fall. Then he managed to get the tip of his right foot onto another jutting rock, for more support, but he could neither pull nor push himself any further up. He hung there, by a hand and a foot - and they were already beginning to tire. It seemed that he would have about twenty minutes before his strength gave way. There was no point in shouting, as no one would hear, and it would weaken him faster. He imagined his fellow guests entering the dining room, sitting down and joking about his absence. By the time anyone became worried enough to come look for him, he would be rolling down the stream as 'a ghastly mass’.
>
> Since he appeared to be doomed, Stephen applied himself to seeking a suitable state of mind for dying in. But none of what he had been taught about this solemn process seemed to work. His mind wandered; mainly he just felt annoyed at himself for making such a mistake. He reminded himself that he had about a quarter of an hour to answer the questions of life: what is the universe? What part should we play in it?
>
> All the religions and denominations he had come across - Protestantism, Catholicism, Pantheism - pointed in different directions. He ran through them in his mind, one by one, and had a terrible thought: what if they were all true and he was supposed to believe in all of them at once, but had accidentally failed to believe in one single clause in, say, the Athanasian Creed? God would greet him by saying: sorry, you have been good and kind, but you forgot that clause and must now go to Hell.
>
> Fortunately, Stephen reflected, such uncompromising rules were now out of fashion, like other old ideas, such as the view that human life was vile and despicable. But too much Panglossian positivity seemed wrong too. Did it even matter? Was Leslie Stephen a mere grain of dust in the universe, about to be thrown aside with indifference? He knew that the atoms of his flesh would be dispersed through the stream and would recombine to form other things: the Epicurean view. But it was hard to feel much personal involvement in this. Nor could he find comfort in the thought that a general shared 'humanity', of which he had been a part, would go on without him. Still, he craved 'something like a blessing to soothe the parting moment some sense of sanctification'.
>
> Thinking this, he found a memory arising of a time when he was taking part in a boat race on the Thames, and his boat was well behind the others. As they neared the finish line, it was obvious that he could not win. Yet he continued to row as hard as ever, out of an obscure sense that it was his 'duty' to try his very best. Now, hanging on the rock, he had the same feeling. The game was up, yet he must cling on until the last moment, resisting. This gave him a moral foundation of sorts: one that required no God, nor even any sense of meaning in the universe. It was his own human need to do his duty.
>
> The Victorians had a great feeling for 'duty' as something almost transcendental. George Eliot held it in high regard too: one day, out strolling with a companion, she remarked that out of the three words 'God, Immortality, Duty', she considered the first inconceivable and the second unbelievable, but the third was 'peremptory and absolute'. Darwin also wrote of the 'deep feeling of right or duty' as the 'most noble of all the attributes of man' (and, as with moral attributes in general, he speculated about its origins in the social group). Leslie Stephen himself seems to have been thinking of something similar when he noted, some years earlier and à propos his loss of faith: 'I now believe in nothing, but I do not the less believe in morality.' He added, 'I mean to live and die like a gentleman if possible.'
>
> Today, many of us feel strongly about duty, but it is more likely to be in the context of a specific situation, perhaps in relation to the needs of family or work. To the Victorians, it was almost an entity in itself. Yet it was essentially humanistic: it needed no God to guarantee it but emerged from our own moral nature. It was a human-centred wish to do the right thing, not just by each other, but by our own lives our own humanity.
>
> The ending to the Alpine story (as one might guess from the author's being alive to tell it) was a happy one. Having had his epiphany about duty, Stephen noticed that he might just be able to reach for another handhold if he lunged for it. It would mean taking a swing and abandoning his existing handhold. Still, he had nothing to lose. He reached missed - and began sliding downwards. But almost immediately, he came to a halt. It turned out that another ledge had been there all the time, just below him; it supported him more firmly, and he could step back onto the path again from there. Looking at his watch, he saw that the whole drama had taken five minutes a bad five minutes in the Alps - and that he would be in time for lunch.
>
> At the end of the story, Leslie Stephen hints that it was just story. (Page 257)

***

> Another option, for those who preferred their religion even more humanised, was to set up humanity itself in the place of God or Jesus and worship that instead.
>
> There were precedents for this too. In France, just after the Revolution, a secular 'religion' had briefly held sway, designed to replace the Catholic religion, which the revolutionaries hoped to eradicate. They began by ransacking the churches. They even briefly considered demolishing huge cathedrals, such as the one at Chartres, until an architect pointed out that the rubble of such a building would block the whole of the town centre for years. But they were also aware that people might need a substitute, so they set up personifications such as Reason, Liberty, or Humanity as a focus for devotion. The altar at Paris's Notre-Dame was replaced by one dedicated to Liberty, and the building hosted a Festival of Reason on 10 November, 1793. This included a parade by the Goddess of Reason, played by Sophie Momoro, wife of the organiser AntoineFrançois Momoro. The year after that, the religions of humanity and reason fell out of favour with Maximilien Robespierre, who showed his disapproval by having Antoine-François Momoro and others guillotined, and then introducing his own, more deistic Cult of the Supreme Being instead. That continued until 1801, when Napoleon banned that too and brought back more conventional religious practices.
>
> The idea of venerating abstractions of this sort lived on. In Germany, the philosopher Ludwig Feuerbach suggested following a human religion in his 1841 book The Essence of Christianity (another work that would be translated into English by George Eliot). Feuerbach thought that mono theistic religion had anyway resulted from humans' choosing their own best qualities, naming those qualities ‘God', and worshipping them. So one might as well cut out the middlegod and worship Humanity directly, or at least our moral side. Feuerbach did not attempt to organise such a religion, but others did, notably the French thinker Auguste Comte.
>
> Comte had some excellent ideas: he founded the discipline of sociology and coined the term positivism to describe his belief that our lives could be better governed if they were based on empirical (that is, 'positive') science. His scientific worldview led him to reject traditional religion, but his sociology told him that people seemed to need something ritualistic in their lives to replace it. He therefore designed what became known as the Positivist religion, or the Religion of Humanity. It was dedicated to an abstraction, but there was nothing abstract about its practices.
>
> First, being a Catholic by upbringing, Comte was certain that this religion would need an idealised feminine figure to replace the Virgin Mary. He found such a figure in a woman with whom he happened to be personally fascinated: Clotilde de Vaux. After a life unhappily married to a man who abandoned her, she died young, all of which made her the perfect symbol of gentle, anguished female virtue. In the Religion of Humanity, she loomed larger than humanity itself, it sometimes seems. But for living women, Comte's religion had less to offer: they were expected to devote themselves exclusively to bringing up children.
>
> Then there had to be saints, to replace the Catholic ones. Comte chose a range of artists, writers, scientists, and even some religious thinkers who had shown outstanding human qualities, such as Moses. He an idea borrowed from the named the months of the year after them Revolutionary calendar. And of course, there must be a pope at the head of it all. He seemed prepared to consider himself for this role, but had no time to make it official before he died, in 1857.
>
> After this, the Positivist religion snowballed away and found followers in countries around the world. It had a lasting success in Brazil, because it was adopted by some of the new republic's founders after their 1889. They were attracted by the Positivist philosophy of rationalism and its opposition to war and to slavery. A fine Templo da Humanidade was built in Rio de Janeiro, modelled on the Paris Panthéon and featuring a giant painting of Clotilde de Vaux holding a child. Sadly, its roof collapsed in a storm in 2009. Other Positivist churches are still standing in other parts of Brazil.
>
> Another country where Positivists did well was Britain, where so many were already swimming in doubt's boundless sea. In 1859 - the year that also saw publication of both the Origin of Species and Mill's On Liberty - Comte's English translator Richard Congreve opened a London branch of the Religion of Humanity. Meetings were held mostly in his own home at first. A small congregation listened to sermons and recited the Positivist Creed, with lines such as 'I believe in the coming of the reign of Humanity.' Congreve even spoke, in one sermon, of Humanity as the ‘Great Power whom we here acknowledge as the Highest'. Music was played; poetry was recited. One popular choice was "The Choir Invisible' by George Eliot, expressing her wish to live on in human memory rather than in a heavenly afterlife. The Positivists set it to music, so it could be sung as a hymn:
>
> O may I join the choir invisible 
>
> Of those immortal dead who live again 
>
> In minds made better by their presence: live 
>
> In pulses stirr'd to generosity, 
>
> In deeds of daring rectitude… 
>
> George Eliot herself took a deep interest in humanist and secular ideas, as one can tell from her choice of books to translate. But having met some English adherents of the Positivist church, she steered clear of it. Partly this was because of the same difficulty Forster would have with Jesus Christ: she did not personally like its leader. She and Congreve were neighbours, but she felt that his superficial amiability hid a cold heart.
>
> The other great intellectual figures engaged with themes of religion and science at the time were wary, too. John Stuart Mill wrote an exposé ridiculing the Comtist attachment to ritual. He singled out the way Comte made such a cult of femininity while showing no regard for women's real-life opportunities. T. H. Huxley took one look and summed up the religion as 'Catholicism minus Christianity'.
>
> In fact, some members of the English church of Humanity also had reservations about the excess of ritual, and the result was that must-have feature of all religions: a schism. The split occurred at a meeting in 1881, with the joke going around that - according to T. R. Wright's entertaining account The Religion of Humanity - they had come to Church in one cab and left in two'.
>
> The group that departed from Congreve's was led by Frederic Hargroup rison. He preferred a slightly less elaborate set of imagery and paraphernalia, and thought that 'mumbling Catholic rites in a sordid hole’ made Positivism look ridiculous. There would still be hymns: his wife, Ethel, edited an anthology of them, including numbers such as ‘Hail to Thee! Hail to Thee! Child of Humanity!' But they met in a physically brighter location, Newton Hall off Fetter Lane in London, and Harrison's whole approach was warmer. No one called him cold-hearted; he was exceptionally hearty and humorous. Having seen him out riding one day, Anthony Trollope described him as looking like 'a jolly butcher on a hippopotamus'. Harrison's son Austin left a wonderful portrait of him in his memoirs, recalling his father's hilarious and melodramatic home performances of his favourite author, Shakespeare, continuing until the children had collapsed into too many giggles to go on. He also took on a tutor for them: the hard-up novelist George Gissing, who would enthral them with horror stories from his own very different schooldays, complete with loud 'Thwack!' sounds as he recalled the floggings.

> At other moments, he (Robert G. Ingersoll) could lay on the melodrama, speaking, for example, of the 'ghosts' of religion that dominate history: they have 'spared no pains to change the eagle of the human intellect into a bat of darkness', he intoned. But lo, let the spectres now depart! 'Let them cover their eyeless sockets with their fleshless hands and fade forever from the imaginations of men.’ (Page 288)

> “Is life worth living? Well, I can only answer for myself. I like to be alive, to breathe the air, to look at the landscape, the clouds, the stars, to repeat old poems, to look at pictures and statues, to hear music, the voices of the ones I love. I enjoy eating and smoking. I like good cold water. I like to talk with my wife, my girls, my grandchildren. I like to sleep and to dream. Yes, you can say life, to me, is worth living.” – Robert G. Ingersoll (Page 289)

> “I do believe in the nobility of human nature. I believe in love and home, kindness and humanity. I believe in good fellowship and cheerfulness, in making wife and children happy. I believe in . I believe in free thought, in reason, observation, good nature, and experience. I believe in self-reliance and in expressing your honest thought. I have hope for the whole human race.” – Robert G. Ingersoll (Page 289)

> Of his responses to these [letters from the public] I find the one in my mind the most was the letter he (Robert G. Ingersoll) wrote in 1890 to a man that stays who had approached him saying that he had suicidal feelings. Ingersoll advised him: 'No man should kill himself as long as he can be of the least use to anybody, and if you cannot find some person that you are willing to do something for, find a good dog and take care of him. You have no idea how much better you will feel.' I hope the man took his advice. (Page 290)

> Indeed, Italian Fascism had itself grown from misery. Originating in 1919, the National Fascist Party appealed initially to a cohort of disoriyoung men who had fought in the First World War and then reented turned to find themselves ignored again and abandoned to their poverty. The party restored their sense of belonging and meaning. The very name of Fascism evoked belonging: it came from the Roman symbol of the fasces, or bundle of sticks, which represented the tying together of individuals to create a powerful unity. (Page 305)

> In that same year, 1934, Stefan Zweig published a short biography of Erasmus, filled with his admiration for the great humanist, but also ending by asking the question of why the Erasmian values of peace and reason were so hard to maintain. They had fallen apart in Erasmus's time; they were falling apart now. Why did humanism have this fatal 'weakness'? Humanists seemed to suffer from a 'beautiful error': they allowed themselves to believe that better learning, better reading and better reasoning would be enough to bring about a better world. The world kept proving them wrong.
>
> But what does a humanist do? This was the question over which so many were now puzzling. Do you involve yourself in government and hope to minimise the damage from within? Italians had learned the dangers of that: trying to tone down fascists can merely make you complicit with them. Do you go out on the streets, ready for physical battle? That was not the humanistic way. Do you, then, deplore the rise of barbarism in elegant prose, reminding readers of their humanity in speeches and articles? But most of those who hear the speeches and read the articles probably already agree with you.

> Perhaps, if you want to live and you are in danger, you start by emigrating, as Zweig did. The emotional cost of this was so high, however, that by the time he and his wife, Lotte Altmann, reached their third country of refuge, Brazil, they were mentally as well as physically exhausted. Zweig had lost his library and his notes. He continued writing in Brazil without them; among his last works was a biographical essay on Montaigne, presenting him very much as he had Erasmus: as an antiheroic hero in terrible times, who somehow keeps the humanistic spirit going without despair. But Zweig did despair. He and Lotte took their own lives together in Brazil in 1942. (Page 309)

> The most obvious aspect in which humans needed to pull themselves together, in the aftermath of the Second World War, concerned nuclear weapons. As Jean-Paul Sartre put it in October 1945, the lesson of Hiroshima and Nagasaki was that, from now on, it would always be up to human beings to decide whether they wanted to survive or not the ultimate existentialist decision. (Page 338)

> Another public humanist who phrased the problem in a memorable way was Bertrand Russell. He concluded a 1954 radio broadcast, 'Man's Peril', with a call to make a choice:
>
> > There lies before us, if we choose, continual progress in happiness, knowledge, and wisdom. Shall we, instead, choose death, because we cannot forget our quarrels? I appeal, as a human being to human beings: remember your humanity, and forget the rest. If you can do so, so, the way lies open to a new Paradise; if you cannot, nothing lies before you but universal death.
>
> ‘Remember your humanity, and forget the rest' – the 'rest' being national interests, vanity, pride, prejudice, despair and anything else that gets in the way of choosing to live – became a much-quoted line, not least by Russell himself. He repeated it in another of those international conferences, this one taking place in 1955 and hammering out a manifesto to be signed by concerned scientists, among them Albert Einstein just a few days before his death. The group went on to hold meetings annually, starting in July 1957 in Pugwash, Nova Scotia; thus 'Pugwash’ remained the name attached to the original manifesto as well as the conferences. They still meet today, and have the same aims: minimising proliferation of weapons and promoting political mechanisms to try to make a catastrophic war less likely.
>
> Bertrand Russell continued to be a stalwart of the anti-nuclear campaign, writing about it and taking part in demonstrations for the rest of his life. After one such occasion in 1961, when he spoke to a crowd in London's Hyde Park, he was convicted of 'inciting the public to civil disobedience' and sentenced to a week in Brixton Prison. He was now eighty-nine years old. The magistrate did try to let him off in exchange for a promise of 'good behaviour', but Russell would promise no such thing. Like Voltaire, he became only more fearless and provocative as he went on in life.
>
> Russell worked for many other causes, including environmental ones: he had a prescient sense of the importance of saving the planet's natural resources and emphasised the urgency of this as early as 1948-1949 in his BBC Reith Lectures. (Around the same time, Julian Huxley organised a UNESCO initiative to create the International Union for the Conservation of Nature, which still works with governments and businesses.)
>
> One part of nature almost swallowed Russell up in 1948, before he had a chance to give the Reith Lectures. During a trip that autumn to Trondheim, Norway, he took a flight in the Bukken Bruse, a flying boat'a kind of seaplane that touches down in water directly with its hull, instead of having footlike floats. The weather was bad. Just as the flying boat was about to settle in the water, it was hit by a gust of wind and tipped over sideways. A wing came off, and water flooded into the cabin. Nineteen of the forty-five people on board were killed, including everyone in the non-smoking section towards the front. Most of the smokers, being further back, managed to swim out and were rescued – including Russell, eternal pipe-puffer that he was. He was drenched and had nothing to change into until a kind clergyman lent him a clerical outfit to wear an amusing sight to those who knew Russell's views on religion. One journalist called from Copenhagen and asked him what he had thought about while in the water. Did he think about mysticism and logic? No, he said. "I thought the water was cold.
>
> Russell's campaigns, by their nature, were often against things: nuclear weapons, the depredation of nature, and wars - notably in his opposition to US involvement in Vietnam in the late 1960s, by which time he was well into his nineties. His general attitude towards the world, however, was anything but negative. In an autobiographical talk of 1955, 'Hopes: Realized and Disappointed', he looked back on his prewar optimistic liberalism, which he admitted had become harder to maintain. Yet he would not give it up: 'I will not submit my judgments as to what is good and what is bad to the chance arbitrament of the momentary course of events. One must adapt to changes in the world, of course, but it is also a bad thing to assume that whatever is in the ascendant must be right'. In any case, as he always emphasised, it is for us to decide whether our world becomes more happy than otherwise. (Page 338)
