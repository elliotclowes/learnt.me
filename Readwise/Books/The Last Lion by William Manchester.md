> When he was told that a Londoner over seventy-five years of age had been arrested in Hyde Park for making improper advances toward a young girl in subzero weather, he chortled: “Over seventy-five and below zero! Makes you proud to be an Englishman!”

***

> The Peninsula and Oriental Steam Navigation Company's four-week voyage between the Mother Country and Calcutta, then India's capital, had become a legend. The worst part of the passage was the crossing of the Red Sea. Those who could afford relative comfort bought-for fifty pounds each way, not counting deck-chair rental-port-side cabins going out to India and starboard cabins for the trip home; in time "Port Out, Starboard Home" became the acronym POSH.

> London was not only the capital of the world; it was the largest metropolis history had ever known, bigger than most imperial possessions or even some European powers. As we shall see, in matters of sex the Victorians should be judged, not by what they said, but by what they did; during the century before Churchill's birth the population of the island tripled-then a reproductive record-and London grew from two million souls to five million. (It was also the favorite of expatriates. Over thirty thousand Germans lived there, over fifteen thousand Americans, and more Irishmen than in Dublin.) The advent of trains and steamships had seen London rise as England's greatest port and the largest exporter on earth. The clocks of the world were measured from Greenwich. The Near East and the Far East were so called because they were near and far from London.

> Lloyd's was the world's insurance agent, and had been for two hundred years. In the vaults beneath the City's banks, gold bars rose in gleaming stacks; British securities were worth an astounding £11,333,000,000. The interest on foreign investments alone exceeded £100,000,000 a year. The gold sovereign was the strongest currency on earth; the City, the world's center of finance, commerce, and banking. London was the center of much else. Here, at the time of Churchill's birth, Joseph Lister was pioneering antiseptic surgery. Here Bessemer had perfected his process. Here Darwin, Tennyson, Browning, and Trollope were at the height of their careers. Dickens had been in his grave only four years; John Stuart Mill less than one. And if distant natives became restless, British ingenuity could be counted on to solve the problem: “Whatever happens, we have got The Maxim gun and they have not.”

> In London there were ten mail deliveries a day.

> The reading room of your club carried Punch, the Book of Horse, Blackwood's, Wisden, and Country Life. The favorite London paper was the archimperialist Daily Mail, which, typically, said of lascars: "It is because there are people like this in the world that there is an Imperial Britain. This sort of creature has to be ruled, so we rule him, for his good and our own." Doing so required preservation of the myth of white supremacy; of what we call racism. (Significantly, there was no such word then.) Conditions had improved since pre-Victorian days, when a native could be castrated for striking a white man or hanged for the theft of one shilling and sixpence. Certainly the average Indian or African toiling beneath the Union Jack was far better off than the average Chinese under his warlords, but British colonial hotels still found it necessary to display notices reading: "Gentlemen are requested not to strike the servants." English soldiers arriving in imperial cantonments were coached in how to avoid inflicting blows on the face, where the bruises would show. And Africans were caned frequently, like unruly boys.

> Playing the role of an Übermensch wasn't always pleasant. You paid the price of the myth. In Calcutta it meant wearing a frock coat and top hat in the punishing heat. Even the white linen suits and cork topees worn inland could be cruelly uncomfortable.
>
> Emotional discomfort could be worse. For loving parents the hardest moment came when a boy reached his seventh birthday, time for him to be sent home to school, never again to be seen as a child.

> Health was also a problem. Every newcomer could expect to be laid low by diarrhea-"Delhi Belly."

> If you wanted to see women you would have to stroll toward the shopping district and its center, Piccadilly Circus, then named Regent Circus, with its beguiling statue, now called Eros but then, more primly, Charity.
>
> Wealthy ladies would be accompanied by servants carrying their parcels and followed, at a respectful distance, by their carriages (hence "the carriage trade"), which, if they were upper class, bore heraldic crests on the doors and were driven by coachmen wearing livery. Middle-class women hired their "Parcels Men" by the hour and usually shopped in pairs. An extraordinary number of them were pregnant, though propriety forbade them from venturing out in public after their third month.
>
> Whatever their condition, they would be tightly corseted in armor of whalebone and steel, a cruel fashion which was responsible for internal injuries even among women not carrying children. The point was to show the world that your husband had a comfortable income, that you didn't have to work. So styles were wildly impractical: great loops of ribbon, hoopskirts, lacy caps, silken parasols, dangling ringlets, blunt bustles, frills, petticoats, and layers of silk and satin heavily trimmed with bugles and beads.

> None of them made women attractive to men.

> That was, or was thought to be, their last objective.

> Men were "the coarser sex"; women, as Janet Horowitz Murray found in her study of gender attitudes in nineteenth-century England, were thought to be "softer, more moral and pure." The very existence of sexual desire was denied. It says much about the Victorians that none of them recognized the Ripper murders as sex crimes. This was part of what O. R.
>
> MacGregor calls "the Victorian conspiracy of silence about sex." Occasional male lubricity was grudgingly accepted for the future of the race, though men who lacked it were reassured by William Acton, a distinguished surgeon of the day: "No nervous or feeble young man need... be deterred from marriage by any exaggerated notion of the duties required of him." For a wife, her husband's animal drive was a cross to be borne. Dr. Acton wrote: "As a general rule, a modest woman seldom desires any sexual gratification for herself. She submits to her husband but only to please him; and, but for the desire for maternity, would far rather be relieved of his attentions." A Victorian mother prepared her daughter for the marriage bed with the advice: "Lie still, and think of England." It was in this spirit that Thomas Bowdler, earlier in the century, had published The Family Shakespeare, bearing the subtitle: "In which nothing is added to the Text; but those Words and Expressions are omitted which cannot with Propriety be read aloud in a Family." By contrast, the distributors of a pamphlet which advised couples not ready for children to practice douching were indicted for scheming "to vitiate and corrupt the morals of youth as well as of divers other subjects of the Queen and to incite... to indecent, obscene, unnatural, and immoral practices" by publishing an "indecent, lewd, filthy, bawdy, and obscene book." During the year before their trial, the pamphlet, which the jury agreed was salacious, had sold 700 copies. In the four months of notoriety, sales leapt to 125,000. The issue, it should be noted, was a middle-class issue. Sex was one of the few pleasures not denied to working-class women, and they hadn't the slightest intention of abandoning it. (Their word for lustful was gay.) As for the patricians-ladies like Winston's mother--the upper class had, as it had always had, a moral code all its own.

> The British soldier was given a small island for his birthplace and the whole world as his grave.

> Including Indian sepoys, there were about 356,000 soldiers in the army-at the time of Marcus Ulpius Trajanus, Rome's legions had numbered 300,000 men-including 55 line battalions scattered about India, Ireland, Hong Kong, Bermuda, Ceylon, Malta, Egypt, Gibraltar, Canada, Singapore, the West Indies, South Africa, Barbados, and Mauritius. Their epitaph may be found today on sinking gravestones: "For Queen and Empire." It is inadequate. They died for more than that. So vast an Empire, so vigorous a society, could have been neither built nor held without staunch ideological support, a complex web of powerful beliefs, powerfully held. Alfred North Whitehead defined a civilization in spiritual terms, and Christopher Dawson, in The Dynamics of World History, said: “Behind every great civilization there is a vision." What was the vision of imperial Britain?

> Jingoism was part of it, or rather one of its outward manifestations, and it wasn't confined to the music halls. On the slightest excuse, Londoners in the city's rookeries hung out bunting and gay streamers, crisscrossing mews and alleys where washing was usually hung to dry. Behind the calls to honor, duty, and glory lay the Victorians' firm belief in obedience-absolute obedience to God, the Queen, and one's superiors, in the family as much as in the army.
>
> It was a time of pervasive authoritarianism. The Baptist preacher C. H. Spurgeon wrote of the Victorian wife that her husband "has many objects in life which she does not quite understand; but she believes in them all, and anything which she can do to promote them, she delights to perform."24 Unquestioning submission to orders was taught to schoolboys as soon as they reached the age of awareness;

> Carlyle implored them to devote themselves to work, which was sending coals to Newcastle. They had already made a cult of toil. It dominated their lives, and not just in London. A French visitor to the Midlands in the 1870s wrote: "On entering an office, the first thing you see written up is: 'You are requested to speak of business only." Bradshaw's Handbook to the Manufacturing Districts described "the utmost order and regularity" in the enormous textile mills of Ancoats and Chorlton, and said that visitors were discouraged because they "occupy the time of an attendant, and disturb the attention of operatives throughout the mill. The loss accruing from this cause is frequently more than can be readily estimated."
>
> Until the year of Churchill's birth, working-class children started in the mills on their ninth birthday; then the age was raised to ten. When Parliament passed a "short-time" bill limiting workers to a sixty-hour week, employers were outraged. Safety measures, as the term is understood today, were unknown. This led to what Professor Geoffrey Best calls "Death's continuing Dance around the scene of labour." Toilers in phosphorus factories suffered from "fossy jaw." A thousand miners were killed each year, and more than three thousand railway workers killed or maimed. The proliferation of moving parts was lethal, but mill owners airily dismissed the problem:

> "Workers will be careless." Protests were few and unheard. Writing in The Uncommercial Traveller, Dickens quoted a Shoreditch woman: "Better be ulcerated and paralyzed for eighteenpence a day...

> than see the children starve." Yet, astonishingly, she made no complaint. Like her Queen, she believed that all work, even drudgery, was sacred. The Victorians were never more Victorian than when they stood in church, or around a Salvation Army band, belting out "Art Thou Weary?"26

> This did not declass them. Their social status was their birthright, and nothing could deprive them of it.

> Even if a peer committed murder, he was entitled to a trial by the House of Lords, and if sentenced to the gallows he was hanged with a silken rope. Of course, most of the upper class was merely related to peers.
>
> Given primogeniture, with all property going to the eldest son, including the title, the patriciate was heavily populated with younger sons who had inherited nothing and usually entered the navy, army, church, or diplomatic corps-the traditional order of preference. (Two generations passed before a descendant became a commoner. The firstborn son of the seventh Duke of Marlborough was his heir. The second son was called Lord Randolph Churchill.
>
> Randolph's wife was Lady Randolph Churchill. Their son was simply Mr. Winston Churchill.) Yet all retained the life-style of the aristocracy.
>
> Characteristically, members of the upper class never lifted an unnecessary finger. It was said of Lady Ida Sitwell that she not only did not know how to lace up her own shoes; she would have been humiliated by the knowledge. Churchill's cousin, the ninth duke, while visiting friends and traveling without his valet, or "man," complained that his toothbrush didn't "froth properly."34 He had to be told gently that toothpaste had to be applied to the brush before it would foam. His man had always done that, and he hadn't realized it. Winston himself lived ninety years without once drawing his own bath or riding on a bus.
>
> He took the tube just once. His wife had to send a party to rescue him; helpless, he was whirling round and round the tunnels under London. And all his life he was dressed and undressed by someone else, usually a valet, though during one period by a secretary in her twenties. There are those among his friends who believe that this sort of thing taught him how to use people properly.

> Of course, they didn't cross a bedroom threshold together. On Thursdays each of the hundred-odd guests was assigned a room; a tiny brass frame on the door held a card with his or her name written on it. Wise and worldly hostesses knew who should be paired with whom. Vita Sackville-West later described how they served as accomplices to Victorian and later Edwardian intrigue: "This question of the disposition of bedrooms always gave the... hostesses cause for anxious thought. It was so necessary to be tactful, and at the same time discreet.
>
> The professional Lothario would be furious if he found himself in a room surrounded by ladies who were all accompanied by their husbands. Tommy Brand, on one such occasion, had been known to leave the house on the Sunday morning... Tommy's motto was 'Chacun a sa chacune.' Then there were the recognised lovers to be considered; the duchess herself would have been greatly annoyed had she gone to stay at the same party as Harry Tremaine, only to find that he had been put at the other end of the house.... It was part of a good hostess' duty to see to such things; they must be made easy, though not too obvious." After lights were out, shadowy figures would glide through the darkened hall and everyone would settle in for the night's pleasure. An hour before dawn the butler would appear in the hall bearing a gong. He would strike it once and depart. The same tiptoeing figures would reappear. Presently they would all meet at the breakfast table.47 Breakfast could be bewildering to outsiders. At the table you were expected to be brusque, even rude, to your companion of the night. “Pass the toast," you would say crossly, or "I want the salt." The upper class was always very direct ("I want to pee"), but this went beyond that. It was important to sort out your different roles, to let it be known that you weren't going to break the rules by being demonstrative, or eloping, or doing anything else rash. One-night stands were very rare, but now and then they happened. The story of one, involving a young Frenchwoman, survives. During an evening musicale a handsome gentleman propositioned her. She accepted, and a memorable night followed. Two hours later she was cracking a soft-boiled egg downstairs when he appeared, took a seat, and arranged his napkin. Still aglow with romance, she bestowed a tender smile upon him. He glowered and growled: "Are you going to hog the butter all day?" She was shocked, then enraged. Hurling the butter in his face, she flew upstairs, summoned her maid, packed, and demanded that she be driven to the station at once. She told their stunned hostess that she would never again visit atroce England. She didn't. She wasn't invited.48

> In time he might have overcome his youthful impetuosity, but time was denied him. His greatest misfortune, though he didn't know it then, was a consequence of what was surely the cruelest of all Oxford pranks. Years later he described it to Louis Jennings, a close friend, and Jennings passed it along to another of Randy's friends, Frank Harris, editor of the Fortnightly Review. One evening at Merton a small group of students were discussing a favorite undergraduate topic: the relationship between masters and servants. Randy had firm views on this.
>
> He believed the aristocracy knew instinctively how to handle menials and that the rising merchants-he once told Harris that he regarded them as "jumped-up grocers from Ballarat and shopkeepers from Sydney"–would never learn. That evening he was eloquent; he was applauded; a fellow student handed him an enormous stirrup cup of champagne; he drank it off. It had been drugged. He awoke at daybreak with a ghastly taste in his mouth. He was in a strange room. The wallpaper, in his words, was "hideous-dirty." He turned his head and sat bolt upright, gasping. There was an old woman lying beside him; “one thin strand of dirty grey hair" lay on the pillow. His hopeless questions to Jennings evoked the chilling horror and the pathos of his plight: "How had I got there? What had happened to bring me to such a den?" Did he remember anything? Pas trop; the stirrup cup, and now this. Rising quietly, he slid into his trousers. Abruptly, the hag awoke and grinned.
>
> She asked hoarsely: "Oh, Lovie, you're not going to leave me like that?"53 Randolph vividly recalled that she had “one long yellow tooth in her top jaw that waggled as she spoke."
>
> Obviously, she expected to be paid-this was the ultimate master-servant relationship. Emptying his pockets, he threw all the money he had on the bed.
>
> Her leer grew. Speechless, he struggled into his waistcoat and coat and bolted. As he slammed the door he heard her call, "Lovie, you're not kind!" Then, said Randolph, "Downstairs I fled in livid terror."- He knew his peril; he made for the nearest doctor's office.
>
> There he was treated with a strong disinfectant, but three weeks later a venereal sore appeared on his genitals, followed by lesions elsewhere. He returned to the physician, who treated him with mercury, warned him to abstain from alcohol, and told him he had nothing to worry about. It was a lie. Victorian medicine, confronted with such symptoms, was helpless. Thus it was that at the height of the 1873 Season, even before his entrance into public life, the elegant twenty-four-year-old bachelor son of a duke, the cynosure of aspiring debutantes and their ambitious mothers, was a doomed syphilitic.54
