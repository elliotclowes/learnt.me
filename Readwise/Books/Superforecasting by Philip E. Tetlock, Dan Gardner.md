> "I have been struck by how important measurement is to improving the human condition," Bill Gates wrote. "You can achieve incredible progress if you set a clear goal and find a measure that will drive progress toward that goal.... This may seem basic, but it is amazing how often it is not done and how hard it is to get right." He is right about what it takes to drive progress, and it is surprising how rarely it's done in forecasting. Even that simple first step-setting a clear goal-hasn't been taken. (Page 15)

> hen physicians finally learned to doubt themselves, they turned W to randomized controlled trials to scientifically test which treatments work. Bringing the rigor of measurement to forecasting might seem easier to do: collect forecasts, judge their accuracy, add the numbers. That's it. In no time, we'll know how good Tom Friedman really is.
> But it's not nearly so simple. Consider a forecast Steve Ballmer made in 2007, when he was CEO of Microsoft: "There's no chance that the iPhone is going to get any significant market share. No chance."
> Ballmer's forecast is infamous. Google "Ballmer" and "worst tech predictions" or "Bing" it, as Ballmer would prefer-and you will see it enshrined in the forecasting hall of shame, along with such classics as the president of Digital Equipment Corporation declaring in 1977 that "there is no reason anyone would want a computer in their home." And that seems fitting because Ballmer's forecast looks spectacularly wrong. As the author of "The Ten Worst Tech Predictions of All Time" noted in 2013, "the iPhone commands 42% of US smartphone market share and 13.1% worldwide." That's pretty "significant." As another journalist wrote, when Ballmer announced his departure from Microsoft in 2013, "The iPhone alone now generates more revenue than all of Microsoft."2 But parse Ballmer's forecast carefully. The key term is "significant market share." What qualifies as "significant"? Ballmer didn't say. And which market was he talking about? North America? The world? And the market for what? Smartphones or mobile phones in general? All these unanswered questions add up to a big problem. The first step in learning what works in forecasting, and what doesn't, is to judge forecasts, and to do that we can't make assumptions about what the forecast means. We have to know. There can't be any ambiguity about whether a forecast is accurate or not and Ballmer's forecast is ambiguous. Sure, it looks wrong. It feels wrong.
> There is a strong case to be made that it is wrong. But is it wrong beyond all reasonable doubt?
> I don't blame the reader for thinking this is too lawyerly, a tad too reminiscent of Bill Clinton's infamous "it depends on what the meaning of the word 'is' is." After all, Ballmer's meaning seems plain, even if a literal reading of his words doesn't support that. But consider his full statement, in context, in an April 2007 interview with USA Today: "There's no chance that the iPhone is going to get any significant market share. No chance. It's a $500 subsidized item. They may make a lot of money. But if you actually look at the 1.3 billion phones that get sold, I'd prefer to have our software in 60% or 70% or 80% of them, than I would to have 2% or 3%, which is what Apple might get." That clarifies some things. For one, Ballmer was clearly referring to the global mobile phone market, so it's wrong to measure his forecast against US or global smartphone market share. Using data from the Gartner IT consulting group, I calculated that the iPhone's share of global mobile phone sales in the third quarter of 2013 was roughly 6%. That's higher than the "2% or 3%" Ballmer predicted, but unlike the truncated version so often quoted, it's not laugh-out-loud wrong. Note also that Ballmer didn't say the iPhone would be a bust for Apple. Indeed, he said, "They may make a lot of money." But still there is ambiguity: how much more than 2% or 3% of the global mobile phone market would the iPhone have to capture to be deemed "significant"? Ballmer didn't say. And how much money was he talking about when he said Apple could earn "a lot of money"? Again, he didn't say.
> So how wrong was Steve Ballmer's forecast? His tone was brash and dismissive. In the USA Today interview, he seems to scoff at Apple. But his words were more nuanced than his tone, and too ambiguous for us to declare with certainty that his forecast was wrong-much less so spectacularly wrong it belongs in the forecasting hall of shame.
