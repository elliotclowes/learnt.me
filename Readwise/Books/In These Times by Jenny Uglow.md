> In the past century [before 1793 and the Napoleonic Wars] Britain had often fought France: in the War of the Spanish Succession from 1702 to 1713, the wars of Jenkins's Ear and the Austrian Succession from 1739 to 1748, the Seven Years War from 1756 to 1763 and the American War of Independence, from 1775 to 1783. Yet in some ways this was a completely new enemy, its armies not the hired troops of an absolute monarch but the people of a revolutionary nation. It was easy to underestimate the passion, and fear, that drove these soldiers on. (Page 29)

***

> Debt-ridden students also fled to the army, including Samuel Taylor Coleridge, who signed up secretly as a private in the 15th Light Dragoons in a moment of guilt-ridden frenzy, as 'Silas Tomkyn Comberbache'. He couldn't ride well, had rusty equipment, found himself nursing a man with smallpox and after three months of misery extricated by his brothers, discharged as 'insane'. (Page 32)

***

> The promise of pay in hard times was the principal draw, and the offer of a bounty of several guineas on joining. But the bounty often vanished immediately in buying uniform or paying debts. Even with a meagre increase in 1792, army pay was less than a quarter of what a man might earn as a hand-loom weaver, or a tenth of that brought home by a skilled worker after a week in the dockyards. Desperate for troops, the army stepped up recruiting and employed 'crimps', civilians who kidnapped men, forced them to sign up and held them in 'crimp houses' until they were marched off to a regiment. In September 1794, Londoners rioted and tore down the crimp houses; a year later, in a new round of protests, crowds pelted 10 Downing Street with brickbats. (Page 33)

***

> The man responsible for building up the army was Pitt's close friend and drinking companion Henry Dundas, the bluff, fifty-oneyearold Scottish lawyer and politician who had been Home Secretary since 1791 and would be officially appointed as Secretary for War in 1794. In finding men, Dundas had little difficulty with officers, since the army was a chosen career for younger sons of the aristocracy and 101 SU VAD gentry. But since army commissions were bought, not won by merit or seniority - a cause of much later controversy - this did not necessarily mean the officers had any experience. By 1793, for example, Arthur Wellesley, later Lord Wellington, had stacked up commissions in five regiments without seeing a stroke of action, spending his time drinking, gambling and piling up debts. ¹3 Aged twenty-four when war was declared, he obtained yet another commission, becoming a major in the 33rd Foot.
>
> The officer class was thus a mix of veterans and entirely untried men. As for the ranks, after the American war the army had been cut to a minimum. In 1793 there were fewer than forty-five thousand men in the cavalry, foot guards and line infantry, and two thirds of these were already serving overseas, chiefly in India or Canada.¹4 In the past, when the British fought on the Continent, they had used German mercenaries and now they followed this tradition by hiring twenty thousand troops from Hanover and Hesse. But Dundas also needed to raise new British regiments, no easy task. He turned first to his powerful connections in Scotland. Despite the high cost, Highland magnates were keen to raise regiments, both to gain access to power in London, and to widen their influence through granting and selling commissions to the gentry: in the first two years, the Earl of Breadalbane, the Duke of Gordon, the Countess of Sutherland, Sir James Grant and the Chief of the Mackenzies raised several battalions. ¹5 In comparison to the size of the population, more soldiers and far more officers would come from Scotland than from any other part of the British Isles. Ireland too provided many early recruits, and Scots and Irish soldiers amounted to half the British army in 1794. (Page 33)

***

> The militia was an old institution, dating, it was said, back to the time of Alfred. Since the Civil Wars the British people had been wary of a large standing army under the control of a king, and the county militia was partly designed to balance this centralised force as well as being a professional reserve. The regiments were raised by ballot from men aged between eighteen and forty-five, and the numbers in each county had been set by the Militia Act of 1757. This now posed a problem since industrial towns were growing fast: the percentage of men taken by ballot in Dorset, say, was one in seven, while in Lancashire it was one in forty-five.¹7 0 vartal diw A militiaman was bound to serve for five years. There were exemptions for peers, university dons, clergymen and dissenting ministers, apprentices and clerks, men who had children, even men who were too short (under five feet four), while men could buy themselves out with a £10 fine, or provide a substitute, offering a bounty. But from the start, the militia, like the army, drew unemployed men and those seeking excitement: 'Oldham, March 8th,' wrote Rowbottom. 'Such is the rapid decrease of fustian weaving and the universal pant for glory that Thomas Dobson, James Cheltham and James Wolstoncroft of Northmoor entered into the Derbyshire Militia this day.'18 When the recruiting officer came back in June so many men flocked to him 'that his order was soon stacked and it is supposed he might have had hundreds more, had he wanted them'.
>
> In the county towns, magistrates worked at all hours, swearing in militiamen and arranging for transport and lodgings. Local inns were commandeered as billets, much to the innkeepers' annoyance, as they had to throw out their normal guests, and the bills were paid late, and rarely in full. Backed by the townspeople they begged for proper barracks to be built, and soon an official barrackmaster general took on this massive task. Barracks, the government reasoned, would make it easier to move militia regiments to police disturbances in areas remote from their own homes, where they were less involved. Radicals like John Thelwall understandably saw this as an 'alarming attempt to separate the soldiery from that mass of fellow citizens of whom they are a part; to whom they are allied; and whom it is their duty to protect in the full enjoyment of their liberty and happiness, and not to be made the instruments of their on oppression and ruin'. 19 (Page 34)

> Sailors were often viewed with suspicion, as if they carried a threat of danger, but the ‘honest tar’ – so named from his canvas jacket coated with tar to make it waterproof, the old tarpaulin - was already a symbol of defiance. (Page 56)

***

> For the families of naval officers, war brought anxiety but also hope of advancement and riches. When the sailors were away, often on long missions of months and years, their letters home were treasured and passed round, the replies carefully numbered so that those who received them could see if the sequence was broken, a packet lost at sea, abandoned in a wreck, burnt in a battle. (Page 58)

***

> Edinburgh's old town baffled strangers like the actor Charles Dibdin, climbing 'in winding directions from among that throng of streets, where loaves, stockings, pitchers, hats, cabbages and numbers of other incongruous particulars were painted against the houses to denote the occupations of their inhabitants, who live up stairs into one street, and down stairs into another, burrowing like so many rabbits in a warren'. (Page 70)

> Peel employed parish apprentices and so did Greg. His waterpowered Quarry Bank Mill in the sandstone gorge at Styal had no large local workforce to call on, so he built houses and brought labour in. His Apprentice House was well run but the hours were long and accidents frequent. One boy, Thomas Priestley, looked after two machines each spinning fifty threads, guiding the threads, twisting them when they snapped, and learning to oil the machine.
>
> > Our working hours were from 6 am in summer and winter until 7 in the evening. There was no night workers. We had only ten minutes allowed for our breakfasts, which were always brought up to the mill for us - two days in the week we had an hour allowed us for dinner, while the machines were oiled COO and other days we were allowed half an hour for dinner, when the boys worked overtime they were paid 1d an hour... During the time working, and there was a great deal of cotton in the machine, one of the wheels caught my finger and tore it off, it was the forefinger of my left hand. I was attended by the surgeon of the factory Mr Holland and in about 6 weeks I recovered. (Page 84)

> They had been in Fleet Street since Richard Hoare moved from Cheapside in 1690. Their old banking house was marked by the sign of the Golden Bottle over the door, a gilt case rumoured, quite untruthfully, to contain the leather bottle that Richard had carried when he first came to London with half a crown in his pocket, as if he were Dick Whittington - in fact he was the son of a Smithfield horse dealer, born and bred in the city. The current head was fortythreeyear-old Henry 'Harry' Hoare, known as 'Henry Hoare of Mitcham' from his Adam-style house Mitcham Grove, across the river on the Surrey side, with parkland, hothouses and dairy, 'good hunting at a small distance, good shooting and fishing'.5 The junior partners were his cousins, the brothers Hugh, Charles and Henry Merrick Hoare, jointly known as 'the Adelphi'. They were aged thirty-one, twenty-six and twenty-three respectively, although their sober letters never sound so young:6 Their half-brother, Sir Richard Colt Hoare, had inherited the Wiltshire mansion of Stourhead from their grandfather, 'Henry the Magnificent'. He had left on a long Grand Tour after his wife died six years ago, returning as a passionate antiquarian, devoted to his library, local history and his ravishing estate.
>
> From their front windows, the Hoare partners gazed down on a noisy street where different worlds collided. Lawyers hurried in and out of their chambers in the Temple, stretching down to the river; customers strolled into the booksellers or stared at print-shop windows; messengers ran to the Morning Advertiser, or the publishing house started by John Murray in the 1760s and inherited this year by his son, John Murray II. Just up Chancery Lane was Nando's coffee house, and nearby was Mrs Salmon's Waxworks, where the new proprietors – keeping the Salmon name - displayed wax kings and queens and the splendours of a Turkish seraglio. Further along, on the northern side of Fleet Street, was the shop of Thomas Hardy, bootmaker, secretary to the London Corresponding Society. Next door to Hoare's was the Mitre, where Johnson and Boswell had met, now Macklin's Poets' Gallery, where the print seller Thomas Macklin showed paintings commissioned to illustrate famous English poems, published monthly as engravings. It was an expensive venture and Macklin was hit badly by the war, which stopped the sale of his prints across the Channel. (Page 89)

> Several private banks were dotted down Fleet Street and the Strand to Charing Cross, a busy corridor between the City and Westminster and the West End, all dealing with wealthy landed customers in need of mortgages and loans, or, if they were flush, a safe home for their deposits. Some borrowed to cover their gaming debts and high spending; others to improve their estates or arrange marriage settlements. Each bank had its distinctive clientele: Praed & Co. in Fleet Street had the West Country and Cornish business; Drummond's catered for army agents, Gosling's and Child's for East India Company tycoons; Coutts' dealt with the aristocracy and never with industry; Wright's in Covent Garden looked after the Catholic gentry and Herries Bank in St James's Street, further west, issued cheques for smart travellers setting out on the Grand Tour. (Page 91)

***

> The rule at Hoare's was that one partner was in attendance at all times. They took turns, living in the rooms above the bank for several weeks or months at a time. Harry, small, slight and suffering from bouts of rheumatic fever - but able to hang on to power until he died at the age of seventy-eight - was rarely there, but messengers dashed down to Mitcham, and he oversaw every major transaction. Within the bank, around ten clerks did the day-to-day work. Some lived in, and these were much sought-after posts, held on to with pride: the senior clerk, John Noble, worked here for fifty-two years between 1758 and 1810. A cook and two servants looked after them and laundry maids and other helpers came in daily. The regime for the Hoares' 'Gentlemen of the Shop' was strict: there must be at least one clerk in the bank all the time, even on Sundays and Christmas Day 'which is in every respect to be considered a Sunday'. They had to attend, properly dressed, from nine o'clock, and after the bank closed at five they must stay on until the balance was right. They must not pay drafts on the accounts of gentlemen whose credit was not good, and if they did so 'to excess' they would personally have to make good the deficiencies. Every day at least one clerk went up to the City, going round the brokers.
>
> Their salaries rose early in the war from £80 to £100 for juniors, and from £140 to £160 for seniors, and then stayed at those rates for sixty years. There were perks, like free board and lodging and a Christmas Fund, and extra pay came from a fund based on commissions from the buying and selling of stocks. This was not to be sneezed at as the Brokerage Fund averaged over £3000 between 1799 and 1809, with half going to the two senior clerks and the rest divided among the others. But there was no pension, as John Willoughby had realised in 1788 when he began to set aside 2/2d out of every shilling for his old age, gradually increasing this to 6%2d. He kept records of all his expenditure and income - fruit and coal, candles and fish and salt and pepper - and, after thirty years, he wrote in his neat notebook, 'Independent and left off saving'.8 (Page 91)

***

> More traditional banks, accepting deposits and operating their own credit systems, often acted as go-betweens, arranging for country banks in richer rural areas to discount the bills of British industrialists, buying them at a lower face value and receiving interest until the payment date. The City banks, in turn, dealt with the brokers, who bought and sold stock for clients, and with the jobbers who dealt on their own account. Dealing was noisy and wild. In the Tuesday and Friday markets for foreign drafts and payments, brokers scurried round the Exchange, fixing different rates for bills from Amsterdam and Hamburg, Portugal, Spain and Italy, Dublin and the West Indies, and dealing in government stock and bills from the Exchequer, the Navy and Victualling Offices and the Boards of Ordnance and Transport. The supreme specialists were bill brokers like the Dutch-born Benjamin and Abraham Goldsmid in Capel Court, and their elder brother Asher, a partner in the bullion brokers Mocatta and Goldsmid. They kept a fast sailing boat at Harwich so that they could carry express messages and receive rapid intelligence from their continental agents, and their high reputation abroad made them the government's chief liaison with the City. Yet like all the Jewish dealers they battled against anti-Semitism, in the sneers of their fellow brokers, in political speeches, in articles, poems and satirical prints. (Page 93)

Note: Reminds me of today, how hedge fund use super fast computers and networks for high frequency trading.

> The colonel of each regiment was responsible for clothing, and many had scrimped on the sums given them so that they could make a profit for themselves. Some privates marched without coats, in linen shirts, supplemented with flannel waistcoats given by their officers. Often they had no decent shoes. Across Britain, groups of well-off women provided warm clothing, organised collections and arranged depots. Only a rush of donations saved more soldiers from dying of cold. (Page 104)

> Between groans about her housekeeper, outbreaks of flu, local feuds and the romances and scandals of their circle, Amabel often passed on royal gossip. The great topic of April 1795, pushing the war out of the headlines while the exhausted Flanders troops were trailing home, was the marriage of the Prince of Wales. His debts gigantic - around £630,000, enough to fund an army a and parliament was reluctant to help, having shelled out vast sums to him over the past few years. When George III agreed that the debts would be paid and his allowance raised as soon as he married, the prince looked for a bride. The choice was Caroline, daughter of the Duke of Brunswick, and the omens were not good from the start.
>
> When she arrived in England, Caroline was met at Greenwich by Frances Villiers, Lady Jersey, a clever, malicious and widely feared woman, who was currently the prince's leading mistress. Then, when the prince first saw Caroline, he turned to his aide, allegedly overpowered by the way she smelled, saying, 'Harris, I am not well. Pray get me a glass of brandy.' I HOIH Describing their ill-starred wedding, another aristocratic letterwriter, Lady Maria Stuart, told her friend Charlotte Bedingfield that she and Lady Ailesbury had set out in a sedan chair to St James's around seven in the evening, trotting up 'between two hedges of persons who did nothing but stare at us and make remarks'. The drawing room was impossibly crushed:
>
> > Lady Ailesbury and I stood from the time we arrived till eleven without being able to obtain even a place to lean against. At last Lady A. got a seat and I a door place, just then they said the Royal Processions were coming in, from which we all ran to the middle of the room, and formed two lines between which there was not space enough for the Princesses to pass without great inconvenience in their hoops.
>
> There they stayed for an hour, while the prince and Caroline signed the register. The prince, she heard, was 'serious more than can be told', and one of the equerries told her that he had been so agitated during the ceremony that they expected him to burst into tears. When the royal family finally emerged, 
>
> > they spoke to nobody as they passed by us, except the K. and Q. to a few old men. The Prince looked like Death and full of confusion, as if he wished to hide himself from the looks of the whole world. I think he is much to be pitied. The bride, on the contrary, appeared in the highest spirits, when she passed by us first, smiling and nodding to every one.
>
> On the wedding night the prince fell into the bedroom fireplace drunk. According to his own account, in the days that followed, they had sex three times and that was that: Princess Charlotte was born nine months later. A year later he told Lord Malmesbury that he was sure he was not Caroline's first lover, and she showed 'such marks of filth both in the fore and hind part of her... that she turned my stomach and from that moment I made a vow never to touch her again.
>
> Outside the court circles, Elizabeth Heber's servants had rushed to see the princess showing herself at the windows of St James's Palace, and thought her 'Beautifull very lively and pleasing in her manner & she is allow'd in General to be a pretty little woman - may she long continue pleasing in the Eyes of her Lords & Master.'4 That was a vain hope. Gossip leaked into the papers, and into Isaac Cruikshank's print Oh! Che boccone! (Oh, what a mouthful!'), showing the shivering prince bracing himself with a bottle of Spanish fly.5 Soon the understandably petulant Caroline won her own reputation for sexual voracity and a royal drama of one-upmanship began. A year after the wedding, Charlotte Bedingfield's mother, Lady Jerningham, told her the current state of affairs: The Reconciliation of the Princess remains suspended, it is a dreadful Scandal, and would be very much to be wish'd that it was over." George III became increasingly impatient with his son, and when Princess Charlotte was born in January 1796, he told the doctor, Mr Lockman, or so Ann Michelson reported to her friend Kitty Senhouse, 'he liked its being a granddaughter and he hoped there would be three girls first... it did not appear to me there was much more rejoicing at this birth, than if the Royal Cat had kittened.
>
> The gossip was significant since the titled world was split between those who followed the king and those who belonged to the prince's raffish set. The former went to sober royal breakfasts and levees, lining up against the walls as George III and Queen Charlotte walked up and down to greet them. The latter flocked to Carlton House or to Brighton, where the prince was filling his new pavilion with sumptuous oriental designs, mirrors, lacquer-works and silks. But both sets were obsessed with land and money and title. Their close circles were enlivened by new blood when estates and titles passed to different branches, or when Scottish and Anglo-Irish grandees chose English wives, and as peers married women with far-flung estates their ing landholdings became so scattered that they never even visited some of them. (Page 109)

> Many MPs now had financial, industrial or trading connections but Westminster was still extraordinarily close-knit - one in four MPs was married to the daughter of another member, while many others were the sons or relations of peers, or had married into the peerage. (Page 113)

***

> Rakes young and old also joined private clubs and riotously informal drinking societies. A few had their hair cut short, in the revolutionary style, but they still enjoyed the coarse eighteenth-century jokes of bums and farts and tits, the erotic prints found in backstreet shops, and the taverns, brothels and bagnios of Covent Garden and beyond. In the tense wartime atmosphere, they drank and gambled and duelled and showed off to an unprecedented degree. Members of the Four-in-Hand club, imitating their coachmen and parading in their livery, drove open carriages at top speed from Hyde Park to Slough, drinking at every inn. One or two notorious men, like the Prince of Wales's friend Lord Barrymore, and Pitt's cousin Lord Camelford, who had settled in London after a disastrous and violent naval career, still upheld the brawling libertine ways of the mid-century but few were so extreme. They preferred more formalised aggression, dropping into the boxing saloon in 13 Bond Street run by John 'Gentleman' Jackson, Champion of England after beating Daniel Mendoza in April 1795. Lord Byron later pasted his fire screen with prints of great fighters on one side and actors on the other. Jackson shared the rooms on alternate days with Henry Angelo the fencing master, whose father had taught George III and the Duke of York, had briefly been master of ceremonies at the Pantheon and also ran a school teaching etiquette, riding, fencing and dancing to 'young men of fashion'.¹5 Angelo knew everyone, from Charles James Fox to Byron, his pupil from the age of twelve. In later life, when he retired after an injury fencing with the actor Edmund Kean, he poured his memories into a haphazard ragbag of anecdotes. (Page 115)

> Frances Jerningham had been educated in France herself, but she loved her Norfolk home, Cossey Hall, four miles outside Norwich, and was devoted to her warm-hearted husband, who took a great interest in his estate and wrote a paper on mangel-wurzels. (Page 119)

Note: Apparently a Mangelwurzel is a form of a beet. And what a great name it has!

***

> If trimmings and trains were as gripping as battles and thrones, passions also ran high with regard to the war. Almost every family had someone close to them in the army or navy. This was, in a very personal sense, 'their war', since their property and status were so threatened by the French example. In 1795 a flurry of memoirs appeared Louvet's Narrative of the Dangers, Madame Roland's An Appeal to Impartial Posterity and a new volume of Letters from France by Helen Maria Williams, who had been imprisoned at Paris for six weeks in 1794 with her mother and sister. All these books amplified newspaper reports of the humiliation of the aristocracy. During this conflict Britain's elite would grow in power, but the Revolution had unnerved them and they clung now, more steadfastly than ever, to their titles, their rights of property and their whole way of life. (Page 119)

> In the first week of January 1796, in Suffolk, Randall Burroughes sold most of his bullocks. A few of them were home-bred but mostly Scots and Irish stock bought at September fairs and fattened on East Anglian grass and turnips. Some went to market, some to a Norwich butcher, and the rest were put out to eat turnip tops and make muck for the farm. Next he slaughtered his bacon hogs, one of which weighed '18st 7lb. It was fed on grey peas split by a machine and to every bushel was mixed one of barley meal." In the same week he brought the sheep that had exhausted the meadow grass into the home farm 91 Quen bas a b yard. His men were out checking field drains, hedging, carting and b ploughing fields now bare of turnips or reduced to stubble. There Ort was work indoors - a new staircase in the dairy and granary - and in sta bris the garden: 'finished removing the filbert rows cut down to the new dew pokon cucumber ground'.
>
> While labourers left to join the army and militia, farmers carried on with their seasonal work, totting up the prices, trying to make a living. Burroughes, now in his mid-thirties, was doing well. He had two large farms, one bought after his father's death and the other acquired in 1792 when he married Anne Denton of Burfield Hall: three years later he and Anne moved into Burfield, building a townhouse for her widowed mother in Wymondham, or 'Windham' as he pronounced and usually spelled it. They had four children in the 1790s. While he concentrated on his two farms, he also rented out extra land to tenants.² Like many farmers keen on 'improvement', Burroughes kept a journal. It was baldly factual and any sentiment was reserved for his horses, so vital for ploughing and harrowing, rolling and carting:
>
> > Poor old Carter was so ill as to require to be knock'd on the head. He had been an excellent horse sent to me at Browick, an old coach horse, being worn out many years ago but the excellence of his spirits kept in exertion to their utmost the powers of his body to the last hour & without any stimulus from the carters whip. His age approaching thirty. Quiescet in pace.
>
> Every week was full, not of war news, but of daily tasks, costs and prices, rain and drought. In February his men were threshing the barley in the barn, ploughing fields for oats and laying muck, while his tenant George Bernard worked out deals for the sale of horses and bullocks with a dealer and a butcher: They continued together from 11 o'clock morning 'till near six in the evening, drank three bottles of port wine & two of ale but could not agree upon terms.' In spring the barley was sown and the cattle were turned out to the meadows. In July and August, when Napoleon was rampaging through Italy and making a treaty with Spain, they were cutting and stacking the hay, delayed by sudden storms of rain. Here and on farms across the country, the mowers were out at dawn, bringing their own rakes and scythes, working slowly across the fields, stopping for an hour or two at noon. Behind them came women and boys who strewed the hay to dry and raked it into rows in the afternoon, then gathered it into haycocks. Next day the mowing, spreading and raking resumed, with the haycocks turned and shaken. Flies swarmed, and the horses stood in the shade, ready to carry the haycocks away to be made into stacks, thatched to keep off the rain. Burroughes's mowers were paid one shilling and sixpence per day '& 3 pints of beer'.
>
> He won a reputation for being tough, sacking men if he thought they cheated him, but also fair, putting up wages when the work was harder or longer than expected. His farm servants, hired by the year stayed with him for many years, either living in the farmhouse a tied cottage. He repaid their loyalty by keeping them on in old age: one of his 1798 harvesters was 'E. Plunket an old man to be paid the quantum meruit', as much as he merits. Plunket also earned money his usefulness fading, he was noted as 'an old workman continued out threshing, ploughing, weeding, harrowing and gardening. A year later, of charity'.
>
> But if Burroughes respected the independence of the old labourers, giving them work rather than alms, in these hard times he began paying his ditchers and drainers, cowmen and threshers, by the day or on piece rates. He listed their tasks and noted their surnames Elmers, Barnes, Reeve, Tayler, Plunket, Bunn, Lanham, Tite, Hudson - but they rarely stride into the foreground of his diary. They were always there at harvesting time, when a team of men and women worked together, cutting, binding, gathering, raking and stooking, with scythe, sickle and hook, expected to begin soon after five o'clock in the morning & not to leave off 'till seven at night'. There was beer every day and a feast at the end, and on feast days and holidays they had time off and went out with their 'purse clubs' or friendly societies. In mid-September, when the harvest was done, the barley all in, the clover cut and raked and the turnips hoed, 'they had their frolic':
>
> > I gave them £2 2s od in money & half a leg of beef weighing about 2 stones. All the helpers partook thereof. At home also the maids who had performed the additional labour with great willingness and diligence had a little reward. Mrs Moy was allow'd to invite some of her acquaintances and Andrew Turners family. I gave them 3 bottles of ale 3 of porter 2 of white wine one of rum for punch and they separated after a cold supper about ten o'clock.
>
> The year wore on, the farming round unaffected, or so it seemed, by the war. But it was, in fact, having a profound effect. Burroughes was turning over more land to barley and oats and especially wheat, capitalising on the high price in the market, sending most of his 'combs' -four-bushel loads to the local mill to be ground into flour and meal, and some to grain dealers in the town.
>
> […]
>
> Burroughes counted his profits, and bought more land and farms. In ten years' time he would have over a thousand acres. He was also a Justice of the Peace and served at one stage as Deputy Lieutenant of Suffolk. When he died in 1817, his memorial in Wymondham Abbey would record him as kind, generous and sincere, 'in the discharge of his public duties intelligent and firm at the same time mild and lenient'. (Page 120)

***

> There was great demand for labour, especially when the fleet was laid up for repairs in the winter months. While a farm worker a few miles inland was earning a shilling a week, the shipwrights' wages were six shillings and sixpence: two months out of three they worked double tides, for double wages, and could earn an extra two shillings and sixpence a week as night watchmen. As Frederick Eden commented when he surveyed the poor of the country in the late 1790s, ‘Watermen, at present, have constant employment; but in peace this class of men is almost starving. Tailors, shoemakers, and other tradesmen, more particularly publicans, are in full business: in short, war is a harvest for Portsmouth; and peace, which is so a wished for in most parts of England, is dreaded here.' Yet these good wages were hardly enough. Take one example, said Eden, totting up the sums as he wrote: they had questioned a dockyard worker, aged thirty-five, with a wife and children aged eleven, seven and three: her earnings were no more than fifteen shillings, and while his, with double tides and extra jobs, could reach £36, after subtracting expenses for rent and food you were left with 'Surplus of earnings, £8 8s.':
>
> > The man could give no account of his other expenses, but says they do not exceed his earnings. The sum however of 8 guineas seems very inadequate to provide five persons with the other necessary articles of food they must want, fuel, cloathing &c. No milk is used in this family. They generally breakfast on tea, and sometimes on bread and cheese. A joint of meat is provided once a week; but bread, with a little cheese, constitutes the principal part of their diet. (Page 132)

***

> Like the Ordnance, the Board worked through contractors who could buy in large quantities from local suppliers or even from abroad. Through these contractors the victualling yards in the main ports bought in cereals, wheat, oatmeal, pease and flour, fresh and salted beef and pork, cheese, oil and butter (much of this bought cheaply in Ireland), beer, malt and vinegar. Wine, raisins and brandy came from warsouthern Europe; rum, molasses and sugar from the West Indies; rice from India and beyond. All these were, in theory, allocated according to rule. The Navy Board decided on the number of men needed for each ship, ranging from over eight hundred for the largest ship, and five or six hundred for a seventy-four-gun ship of the line, down to thirty for a gunboat. And although ships rarely sailed with their full complement of men, the size of the fleet grew year by year.The Admiralty set a monthly budget per man and allocated rations according to a strict plan: a pound of bread (the hard bread known as 'bisket') and a gallon of beer every day, four pounds of beef, two pounds of pork and two pints of pease each week, plus three pints of oatmeal, six ounces of butter and twelve ounces of cheese, with occasional substitutes, like wine or spirits instead of beer, or chickpeas and lentils replacing the dried peas.val (Page 133)

> So far there was no official arrangement to inform relatives of a soldier's death, or to let him send home his pay. It was not until 1797 that the Duke of York ordered commanding officers to report the names of the dead to the War Office, and not until 1809 that family members could petition for a dead man's effects. But a sailor could send half his money home each month, usually to his wife or mother, and in 1796 the navy set up the Allotment Office to record the details of all the seamen who were allotting wages to their families: the commanding officer had to help each man fill out the forms in triplicate, giving his name, that of the recipient and their address, and the number of children, specifying the number of boys. One copy went to the Navy Office, one to the official who would distribute the money, and the third to the woman herself. Every month she would turn up to receive the money from the designated tax collector, bringing the form and a pass signed by the minister or churchwarden to prove her identity. The amounts were small but vital, £5 or £6 each month. If the man was killed or died, she came back to the same official to receive a lump sum, including back pay, and any uncollected prize money - sometimes as much as £150, enough to change a life (Page 152)

> There was also a rigid division between [the French] officers and men. The officers were given a passport to a parwest ticular parole depot, an alphabetical net flung over the south and of England, from Alresford, Ashburton and Ashford to Peterborough and Tavistock. Local magistrates arranged for them to be billeted in houses or inns, and they gave their parole - their word of honour - not to escape, to obey an evening curfew and to walk no more than a mile from the town. Townsfolk put up milestones to mark the limit, like the stretch of road near Derby still known as Frenchman's Mile, or picked out special features like the tree at Whitchurch, which became known as the Honour Oak.

> But while the young warrior and his invincible republicans were charging through Italy, collecting sculptures and paintings as they went, the British public could still take comfort in the thought that they had the best of the French at sea. Admiral Jervis's victory at the battle of St Vincent on 14 February was held up as an example of British pluck and daring matching Howe's 'Glorious First', and it also gave the country a new hero. Jervis had intercepted Spanish ships off Cape St Vincent, the south-western tip of Portugal, driven off course as they were sailing to join the French at Brest. As the British ships sailed through the Spanish line, raking each vessel with broadsides, the young Commodore Horatio Nelson hooked his ship Captain on to the Spanish San Nicolas, boarded it and used it as a bridge to leap across to a second ship, the massive San Josef.

> Tom Gill from the Isle of Wight, who was there on the Colossus under Captain George Murray, wrote home excitedly, but when the Revd Gill and his daughters read his account, it seemed far more confusing than the papers suggested. Even in later recollections, Tom remembered more chaos than heroism. First, after a signals error, they were rammed by another British ship, the Culloden, and although the ship's carpenters patched the hole rapidly, the damage 'interrupted the working of four of the guns, and this, unluckily, was the side we were forced to present to the enemy soon after'. In the actual engagement, after they beat to quarters and stood by their guns, they waited in silence as the great ships came together, not firing until they were almost alongside, but by that time their fore-topgallant yard was shot away, the main mast and bowsprit damaged, the rigging cut to pieces and the sails ragged with holes. The sailors on board had little sense of the general battle: 'to describe it is impossible. An individual may know tolerably well what is going on in his ship, but no more." (Page 173)

Note: I think there’s a real metaphor at the end there in how the guy from battle said how you could be vaguely aware of your ship, but often had no clue about the overall battle. Many things in life is like this. I think it’s also interesting because I could imagine it might be easy to get caught up in dispair or happiness about your situation, when outside the overall battle is a very different story.

> To keep up the blockade on the Dutch navy, Duncan set off in the Venerable with only the fifty-gun Adamant and the frigate Circe to back him. On the blockade he managed to trick the Dutch into believing the whole squadron was there by disguising his vessels to look like different ships each day, and sending signals to non-existent ships over the horizon. When the three ships came back, the Yarmouth merchants, organised as usual by Samuel Paget, took up a collection of £54 to reward their loyalty, which was spent on porter and vegetables for the crews.

> At Christmas children ran to the woods for ivy branches and the morris dancers performed plays. In spring came Valentine's Day, Shrove Tuesday and then April Fool's Day, tricking people into errands like fetching pigeon's milk. On St Mark's Eve, 24 April, girls baked a 'dumb' cake, ate it in silence at midnight and walked backwards to bed, to see the likeness of their sweethearts hurrying after them'.9 May Day had races and dances round the maypole, and in Clare's village the first cow into the pasture wore a garland on its head, the last a thorn on its tail, and the garland was given at the end of the day to the Queen of the May. Then came the summer feasts for haymaking and the sheep shearing, and in the north the rushbearings, where clean rushes were carried to the church on flower-decked wagons to be strewn over the earth floors. Even in hard times, autumn fairs and harvest home had stalls of toys, sugar plums, lollipops and gingerbread - and then the year ran round to Christmas again. (Page 195)

> The spring of 1800 looked promising, and the hay crop was good, the scent of the stacks drifting far over the fields. Yet the price of bread stayed high. By April, flour that had cost just over one shilling a peck at the start of the war was between four and five shillings. Labourers cut bacon, the cheapest meat, out of their diets. Nettles became popular, selling for twopence a pound, eaten with salt and pepper: 'Nettles, parliance, docks, green saus, water cresses &c are plucked up by the poor people as a substitute for potatoes,' wrote Rowbottom, 'and scores of poor wretches are wandering in a forlorn state eagerously picking up any sorts of vegetables which fall their way.'¹6 Workers blamed bakers, bakers blamed millers, millers blamed dealers, middlemen and farmers, accusing them (often correctly) of making private deals or holding back stocks, banking on even higher prices.

> Wilberforce built up a cohort of about forty members in the Commons, and evangelical influence was also strong in the army, navy and City. Its power showed in a rash of new societies, from the Church Missionary Society in 1799 and the Society for Promoting the Religious Instruction of Youth in 1800 to the nicely named Female Friendly Society for the Relief of Poor, Infirm, Aged Widows and Single Women of Good Character, Who Have Seen Better Days.

> After the principle of union was agreed in the cabinet, Pitt and his team in Dublin worked tirelessly to persuade the Dublin parliament to vote itself out of existence, bribing, bullying and handing out peerages. Finally it did so. On 2 July in Westminster and 1 August in Dublin, twin Acts of Union were passed. These came into effect on 1 January 1801. A hundred Irish MPs were added to the House of Commons and four bishops and twenty-eight peers to the Lords. The Churches of England and Ireland were joined, there was a new flag for the ‘United Kingdom', and a new royal seal and title for the king although, to the dismay of devoted loyalists, this dropped the ancient claim to be King of France. (Page 274)

> But on Saturday 14 March 1801 Pitt finally stepped down, after seventeen years as Prime Minister. All his close allies went with him, a tumble of familiar names: Grenville, Dundas, Windham, Spencer, Canning, Castlereagh and Cornwallis. (Page 275)

> The aristocracy had clung to their love of France throughout the war: they spoke French at parties, used French phrases in letters, bought French furniture and Sèvres porcelain, smuggled in French wines and brandy, adored the haute cuisine and served French dishes at their dinner parties. Now Paris fashions were available again, velvet hats and sable muffs, embroidered shawls and silklined cloaks. A shocked colonel reported that the French women's dresses were 'nothing more than Petticoats and Shoulder straps'. (Page 292)

> In Fleet Street Harry Hoare invested in expensive new 'drill Jackets and Pantaloons' for his men and hired a Sergeant-Major Jennings and Sergeant Birch to supervise drilling. He also laid out the considerable sum of £44 10s for twelve Brown Bess muskets- enough for all the clerks and two partners - from Henry Nock, the leading London gunsmith, whose shop was up the road in Ludgate Hill. (Nock ran a shooting ground in Blackfriars and a factory in Whitechapel, and supplied muskets to the king: when he died the following year, his son-in-law James Wilkinson took over, later turning to making swords, bayonets and razors - hence Wilkinson Sword.) Hoare's muskets still in their glass cases in the bank's lobby were particularly fine, engraved with the bank's sign of a golden bottle and Nock's initials. (Page 349)

> Nelson was back in London this summer while the Victory was fitted with a new rudder, and on 12 September, waiting at the Colonial dhe Office for his instructions from Castlereagh, he bumped into Arthur mula Wellesley, home from India after his successes in the Maratha war: this month he would be made a Knight of the Bath. Years later Wellington remembered being appalled by Nelson's swagger until Nelson, having briefly left the room and discovered who he was, completely dropped his boasting. Amused at the transformation, by the time he left Wellington was charmed: 'luckily I saw enough to be satisfied that he really was a very superior man; but certainly a more sudden and complete metamorphosis I never saw.'9 It was the only time they met. Nelson sailed three days later from Portsmouth. (Page 398)

> To have been at Trafalgar, as the families of all naval men knew, was to be a hero, rich, rewarded, promoted. Although only four of the captured French ships survived the gales on the way back, parliament voted a staggering £320,000 to be distributed round the fleet. Each citiem captain had £3300, plus prize money and gold medals, while Lloyd's Patriotic Fund handed out silver vases with designs by John Flaxman, who was soon to be commissioned to sculpt the Nelson monument in St Paul's. Officers received beautifully chased swords, and money was given to the wounded (Page 400)

> July, Captain Hugh Mind-Your-Eye' Crow, a veteran of the Guinea trade, sailed the Kitty's Amelia, the last British slaving ship to leave Liverpool. Arriving at the river Bonny on the Niger delta, he found baffled British captains waiting for the next cargo of slaves, unsure if the rumours of abolition were true. They were, he told them, and the British trade would be completely banned from January 1808.6 Four ships sailed from the Gulf of Guinea in October, protected by a British warship for the last time: from now on the warships would stop slavers, not help them. But Liverpool merchants were still importing sugar and tobacco from the Caribbean and cotton from slave-owning plantations in Brazil, and many slave-ship owners simply moved their vessels to the West Indies, South America or the Azores, or sailed under Portuguese or Spanish colours, with foreign officers and papers. Now that the trade was illegal, profits were all the greater: fast sailing schooners were still taking hundreds of slaves from the barracoons and forts, or loading them by canoes from the mangrove swamps all round to the Bight of Benin and the great slave port of Whythe way dah (modern Ouidah), where thousands were brought down from the interior of Dahomey each year. A defiant trade continued among the Liverpool captains, Thomas Clarkson reported, with ships picking up slaves in Africa alongside their official cargoes.7 It would take a long time for this to change, and another twenty-six years for slavery itself to be abolished in all British dominions. (Page 433)

> Even Napoleon - who now employed a hundred thousand excisemen on the coasts of Europe - accepted that ships must break the rules if his own farmers and merchants were not to be ruined. In September 1808, the West Riding wool merchants reported a coup in fulfilling £40,000 worth of contracts with the French army - paid in full. French troops in Poland, it appears, were wearing boots made in Northampton as well as greatcoats of West Riding cloth. In the Baltic, the small island of Heligoland, captured after the bombardment of Copenhagen, was soon a booming centre. John Longsdon, and writing home to his farmer father, described it here as an agent as a tiny place less than a mile long, with one road, called the Lower Town, and two thousand people, five or six cows, two hundred sheep, thirty goats and some pigs. But in 1810, when the British built a lighthouse there, around three hundred ships a day were calling in and the total value of products that passed through each year soon reached around £20 million. British merchants rented warehouses at and local pilots made good money. From Heligoland the high profit goods were run in through Hamburg, whose port officials resented Napoleon's strict decrees. Once landed, the goods were carried further inland in double-bottomed carts and even in coffins. (Page 447)
