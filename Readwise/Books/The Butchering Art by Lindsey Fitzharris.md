## Highlights

> At six feet two, Liston was eight inches taller than the average British male. He had built his reputation on brute force and speed at a time when both were crucial to the survival of the patient.
>
> Those who came to witness an operation might miss it if they looked away even for a moment. It was said of Liston by his colleagues that when he amputated, "the gleam of his knife was followed so instantaneously by the sound of sawing as to make the two actions appear almost simultaneous." His left arm was reportedly so strong that he could use it as a tourniquet, while he wielded the knife in his right hand. This was a feat that required immense strength and dexterity, given that patients often struggled against the fear and agony of the surgeon's assault. Liston could remove a leg in less than thirty seconds, and in order to keep both hands free, he often clasped the bloody knife between his teeth while working.
>
> Liston's speed was both a gift and a curse. Once, he accidentally sliced off a patient's testicle along with the leg he was amputating. His most famous (and possibly apocryphal) mishap involved an operation during which he worked so rapidly that he took off three of his assistant's fingers and, while switching blades, slashed a spectator's coat. Both the assistant and the patient died later of gangrene, and the unfortunate bystander expired on the spot from fright. It is the only surgery in history said to have had a 300 percent fatality 10 rate (Page 10)

> The traumas of the operating theater could take a toll on student spectators too. The Scottish obstetrician James Y. Simpson fled an amputation of the breast when he was studying at the University of Edinburgh. The sight of the soft tissues being lifted with a hook-like instrument and the surgeon preparing to make two sweeping cuts around the breast proved too much for Simpson. He forced his way back through the crowd, exited the theater, hurried through the hospital gates, and made his way up to Parliament Square, where he declared breathlessly that he now wished to study law. Fortunately for posterity, Simpson-who would go on to discover chloroformwas dissuaded from pursuing a change of career. (Page 11)

> Like many surgeons operating in a pre-anesthetic era, Liston had learned to steel himself against the cries and protests of those strapped to the blood-spattered operating table. On one occasion, Liston's patient, who had come in to have a bladder stone removed, ran from the room in terror and locked himself in the lavatory before the procedure could begin. Liston, hot on his heels, broke the door down and dragged the screaming patient back to the operating room. There, he bound the man fast before passing a curved metal tube up the patient's penis and into the bladder. He then slid a finger into the man's rectum, feeling for the stone. Once Liston had located it, his assistant removed the metal tube and replaced it with a wooden staff, which acted as a guide so the surgeon wouldn't fatally rupture the patient's rectum or intestines as he began cutting deep into the bladder. Once the staff was in place, Liston cut diagonally through the fibrous muscle of the scrotum until he reached the wooden staff. Next, he used the probe to widen the hole, ripping open the prostate gland in the process. At this point, he removed the wooden staff and used forceps to extract the stone from the bladder.

> Liston-who reportedly had the fastest knife in the West Endachieved all this in just under sixty seconds. (Page 12)

> As it turned out, the two decades immediately following the popularization of anesthesia saw surgical outcomes worsen. With their newfound confidence about operating without inflicting pain, surgeons became ever more willing to take up the knife, driving up the incidences of postoperative infection and shock. Operating theaters became filthier than ever as the number of surgeries increased. Surgeons still lacking an understanding of the causes of infection would operate on multiple patients in succession using the same unwashed instruments on each occasion. The more crowded the operating theater became, the less likely it was that even the most primitive sanitary precautions would be taken. Of those who went under the knife, many either died or never fully recovered and then spent the rest of their lives as invalids. This problem was universal. Patients worldwide came to further dread the word "hospital," while the most skilled surgeons distrusted their own abilities. (Page 17)

> statAt five feet ten inches, Lister was taller than most of his classmates. Those who knew him often commented on his striking s ure and the gracefulness with which he moved. He was classically handsome at this age, with a straight nose, full lips, and brown wavy hair. He had a nervous energy about him that became more pronounced in the company of others. Hector Charles Cameron-one of Lister's biographers and a friend in later years-recalled the first time he met the future surgeon: "When I was admitted to the drawing-room Lister was standing with his back to the fire, tea cup in hand. As I remember him he was nearly always standing. If for a few minutes he was seated, some new turn in the conversation seemed inevitably to force him to his feet."
>
> Lister's mind was in a constant whirl of activity. When he was agitated or embarrassed, the corner of his mouth twitched, and a stammer that had plagued him in his early childhood would return.
>
> Despite this inner turbulence, Lister was described by the Stewart of Halifax as having an “indescribable air of gentleness, verging on shyness." A friend would later write of him, "He lived in the world of his thoughts, modest, unmasterful, unassuming."
>
> Lister was a sober character, made all the more so by his upbringing. His community's religious teachings stipulated that people of his faith wear somber colors at all times, and address others using antiquated pronouns such as "thee" and "thou." As a child, Lister was surrounded by a sea of black coats and broad-brimmed hats, which the men of the family never removed, even during church services. The women dressed in plain garments with folded kerchiefs around the neck and plain shawls on their shoulders. They wore white muslin caps known as coal-scuttle bonnets. When Lister headed off to university, he donned muted colors in deference to his faith, which, among the more fashionable students of his class, no doubt made him stand out as much as his height. (Page 28)

> At the time, the term "medical student" had become a "by-word for vulgar riot and dissipation," according to the physician William Augustus Guy. This sentiment was universal. An American journalist observed that medical students in New York were "apt to be lawless, exuberant, and addicted to nocturnal activities." They were often a rough-looking lot who congregated in cheap lodgings and inns surrounding the great teaching hospitals. They dressed fashionably-almost gaudily-except for their distinctly grimy shirts.
>
> They walked around with cigars hanging from their mouths: an indulgence, but one that was a necessity for masking the smell of decay that permeated their clothes after time spent in the dissection room. They were the brawling, boozing, boisterous types, judging by the number of warnings against bad behavior that instructors gave to their pupils (Page 31)

> Very few were granted admission onto the wards. This wasn't unusual. In general, a sick person had one-in-four chance of gaining entry onto a ward of a city hospital.
>
> In 1845, King's College Hospital treated all but 1,160 of the 17,093 people who came through its doors as outpatients. Most hospitals had a “takingin day" designated for admitting new patients onto the wards. This might happen only once a week. In 1835, The Times reported an incident in which a young woman suffering from a fistula, inflammation of the brain, and consumption was turned away from Guy's Hospital in London on a Monday because taking-in day was Friday. Returning on the appropriate day, the woman arrived ten minutes late and was refused admittance because of her lack of punctuality. Dejected and seriously ill, she returned to the countryside, where she died a few days later.
>
> of In the nineteenth century, almost all the hospitals in London except the Royal Free controlled inpatient admission through a system of ticketing. One could obtain a ticket from one of the hospital's "subscribers," who had paid an annual fee in exchange for the right to recommend patients to the hospital and vote in elections of medical staff. Securing a ticket required tireless soliciting on the part potential patients, who might spend days waiting and calling upon the servants of subscribers and begging their way into the hospital.
>
> Preference was given to acute cases. "Incurables"-people with cancer or tuberculosis, for instance-were turned away, as were people with venereal infections (Page 62)

> Lister's testimony was damning. Sullivan was found guilty of attempted murder and sentenced to twenty years' transportation, which meant he would be banished to a penal colony in Australia. Due to the mounting pressure of London's overcrowded prisons, 162,000 convicts were transported to Australia between 1787 and 1857. Seven out of eight of these were men. Some were as young as nine, others as old as eighty. Transportation was no easy alternative to imprisonment or hanging. The convicts were first sent to hulks, or floating prisons, on the Thames. The conditions on these decommissioned, rotting ships were horrendous, and even the hospitals could not compete with them as breeding grounds for disease. Prisoners were locked in cages belowdecks in appalling surroundings. One guard remembered "seeing the shirts of the prisoners, when hung out upon the rigging, so black with vermin that the linen positively appeared to have been sprinkled over with pepper." During cholera outbreaks, the chaplain often refused to bury the dead until there was deemed to be a sufficient quantity of bloated, decomposing corpses of which to dispose. If a prisoner survived the hulks, he was shipped to Australia. One in three died on the grueling sea passage, which could take as long as eight months. If convicts behaved themselves, their sentence could be reduced by a "ticket of leave," which would allow them to return home. The majority, however, never made it back to Britain, choosing to live out the remainder of their miserable lives in exile rather than endure the treacherous sea passage to an English port.

> When the Great Exhibition in Hyde Park opened, there were approximately 100,000 objects from more than fifteen thousand contributors on display, them a printing machine that could turn out five thousand among copies of The Illustrated London News in an hour; "tangible ink" that produced raised characters on paper for the blind; and a handful of velocipedes, the predecessor of the modern bicycle, with pedals and cranks on the front axle. The biggest exhibit by far was a massive hydraulic press, which could be operated by just one man, even though each metal tube weighed 1,144 tons. There was also the world's first major installation of public flushing toilets, designed by the Victorian sanitary engineer George Jennings. Some 827,280 people paid one penny to use the facilities during the exhibition, which gave rise to the popular euphemism "spending a penny." But such a luxury would not ameliorate the squalor of Britain's poorest households for many years to come. (Page 77)

> LISTER LIVED FOR MANY DECADES after his theories and techniques had been accepted, and he was eventually celebrated as a hero of surgery. He was appointed personal surgeon in ordinary to Queen Victoria-the term "in ordinary" signaling that it was a permanent position. In the final decades of his life, official accolades came thick and fast. He was awarded honorary doctorates from the Universities of Cambridge and Oxford. He was awarded the Boudet Prize for the single greatest contribution to medicine. Shortly afterward, he attended the International Medical Congress in London. In contrast to his circumstances at the first of these gatherings, held in Philadelphia, Lister's reputation and methods had reached their acme by the time the medical community reconvened in the British capital. He was also knighted and made a baronet; he was elected president of the Royal Society; he was raised to the peerage and titled Lord Lister of Lyme Regis; he helped found the medical research body that would later be named in his honor, the Lister Institute of Preventive Medicine; and ten years before his death he was made privy councillor and honored with the Order of Merit-all for his work in science and medicine (Page 229)

> Medical voyeurism was nothing new. It arose in the dimly lit anatomical amphitheaters of the Renaissance, where, in front of transfixed spectators, the bodies of executed criminals were dissected as an additional punishment for their crimes. Ticketed spectators watched anatomists slice into the distended bellies of decomposing corpses, parts gushing forth not only human blood but also fetid pus. The lilting but incongruous notes of a flute sometimes accompanied the macabre demonstration. Public dissections were theatrical performances, a form of entertainment as popular as cockfighting or bearbaiting.
>
> Not everyone had the stomach for it, though. The French philosopher Jean-Jacques Rousseau said of the experience, "What a terrible sight an anatomy theatre is! Stinking corpses, livid running flesh, blood, repellent intestines, horrible skeletons, pestilential vapors! Believe me, this is not the place where [I] will go looking for amusement
