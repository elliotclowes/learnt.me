### [[Longitude]] and the Canary Islands

^487b1f

> The [[Romans]] knew of the [[Canary Islands]], a smattering of rocks off the coast of Morocco, which they called the Fortunate Islands and from which they measured [[longitude]] - all points to the east. (Page 5)

**Note**: There doesn't seem to be any concrete evidence that these islands were used systematically by the Romans as a prime meridian for longitude measurements.

The concept of longitude was understood in a basic form by the Romans, but they lacked the precise methods to measure it accurately. Longitude is challenging to determine without accurate timekeeping technology.

And whilst Roman geographers like [[Ptolemy]] (though he's more Greek than Roman. He lived in Roman-ruled Egypt, but he and Egypt was culturally Greek) had theories about the Earth's geography, including ideas about longitude, these were based more on mathematical calculations and estimates rather than empirical measurements from a fixed reference point like the Canary Islands.

[[The Greeks]] did often have the meridian passing through the Canary Islands or through Alexandria as reference points in their geographical calculations. However, these were not universally adopted standards, and the methods were inconsistent.

So I guess *technically* they measured longitude from the Canary Islands. But it was mostly just theory. And wouldn't have been used for during actual sailing.

### Chinese banning shipbuilding

> The astonishing tribute fleets of the Ming were comparatively as advanced and as expensive as moon shots - each one cost half and they left as little behind the country's annual tax revenue as footprints in the lunar dust. In 1433, during the seventh expedition, Zheng He died, possibly at Calicut on the Indian coast. He was most likely buried at sea. After him, the star rafts never sailed again. The political current in [[China]] had changed: the emperors strengthened the [[Great Wall]] and shut themselves in. Ocean-going voyages were banned, all the records destroyed. In 1500 it became a capital offence to build a ship with more than two masts; fifty years later it was a crime even to put to sea in one. The technology of the star rafts vanished with Zheng He's body into the waters of the Indian Ocean; they left behind a power vacuum waiting to be filled. (Page 6)

**Note**: According to my GPT-4 research it wasn't a capital offence to build a ship with more than two masts. That appears to be wrong. However there was strict laws about shipbuilding (part of a broader policy known as the "haijin" (海禁)). And the penalties for violating these maritime restrictions were firm. You might be given the death penalty if you violated these laws *as well as* carried out piracy or treason.

> The royal household projected these voyages to the pope as crusades – continuations of war with Islam. The Portuguese had expelled the Arabs from their territory far earlier than their neighbours in Castile and established a precocious sense of national identity, but the appetite for holy war remained undimmed. As Catholic monarchs the royal house of Aviz sought legitimacy and parity on the European stage as warriors for Christ. In a Europe that felt itself increasingly threatened by militant Islam, particularly after the fall of Constantinople in 1453, they obtained from the papacy spiritual and financial concessions and territorial rights over explored lands in the name of Christ. The crusading remit from Rome was 'to invade, search out, capture, vanquish and subdue all Saracens and pagans whatsoever, and other enemies of Christ petual slavery'. (Page 14)

> They were impelled too by a desire to do great deeds. Henrique and his brothers were half English - their mother was Philippa of Lancaster, granddaughter of Edward III; their cousin was Henry V, the victor at Agincourt. An atmosphere of knightly chivalry, fuelled by their Anglo-Norman ancestry and medieval romances, hung heavily around the royal court and infused its restless nobility with a high-octane mixture of prickly pride, reckless courage and a desire for glory, linked to crusading fever (Page 14)

> Black-bearded and long-faced, well-built, and somewhat melancholy in expression, with 'an air of such gravity and authori ty that everyone recognised him as king', João was 'a man who commanded others and who was commanded by no one'. He was perhaps the most remarkable European monarch of the early modern age. To the Portuguese people he would pass into history as the Perfect Prince. His rival Isabella, queen of Castile and then the unified kingdom of Spain, gave him the ultimate accolade. She simply referred to him as "The Man'. João was preoccupied with 'the deep desire to do great things', and the first of the great things to which he stretched out his hand was the exploration of Africa. On his accession he embarked on an intense fiveyear period of state-funded exploration in which he hoped to fulfil two objectives: find a route to the Indies and reach the fabled kingdom of Prester John. It was Diogo Cão, erecting pillars along the west coast of Africa, to whom he had entrusted this task. (Page 18)

> Far away in the Indian Ocean itself, Covilhã was still travelling. In the autumn of that year, he caught a trading dhow across the Indian Ocean to Calicut (now Kozhikode), the hub of the spice trade and the terminus for much of the long-distance commerce from further East. By early 1488 he was probably in Goa, then sailed north to Ormuz at the mouth of the Persian Gulf, another hub of the Indian Ocean. Crisscrossing the ocean, collecting and secretly recording information about sailing routes, winds, currents, ports and politics, he picked up a ship going from the east coast of Africa to Sofala, far to the south, opposite Madagascar, the furthest point of Arab navigation in the southern Indian Ocean. He was attempting to find out about the feasibility of rounding Africa by sea, and navigation along its east coast. By the time he returned to Cairo in 1490 or early 1491 he had been travelling for almost four years; he had scouted the major trade routes of the Indian Ocean and was in a position to provide the king with a detailed account.
> Back in Cairo he learned that Paiva had died, somewhere on the way to Ethiopia. Meanwhile João had sent out two Jews, a rabbi and a shoemaker, to look for his lost spies. Mysteriously, they somehow found and recognised Covilhã in the hubbub of Cairo and brought him letters from the king. The order was to return to Lisbon, but not before 'he had seen and found out about the great king Prester John'. Covilhã wrote the king a long letter, sent back with the shoemaker, detailing everything that he had seen and knew - about the trade and navigation of the Indian Ocean, and that 'his caravels that frequent Guinea, by sailing from place to place and seeking the coast of the isle of Madagascar and Sofala, could easily enter these eastern seas and reach the shore of Calicut, because there is sea all the way'.
> By this time Covilhã seems to have been bitten by incurable wanderlust. He decided to finish off Paiva's business but interpreted João's orders freely. Accompanying the rabbi to Aden and Ormuz, he then made his own heavily disguised tour of the holy places of Islam - Mecca and Medina - before striking out for the Ethiopian highlands. Here he became the first Portuguese to meet the man they knew as Prester John, the Christian emperor of Ethiopia. The current ruler, Eskender, received him honourably but refused to let him leave. He was discovered in the country thirty years later by a Portuguese expedition, to whom he would tell his story. He remained in Ethiopia until the day he died. (Page 35)
