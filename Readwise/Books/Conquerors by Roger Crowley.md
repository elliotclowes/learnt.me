### [[Longitude]] and the Canary Islands

^487b1f

> The [[Romans]] knew of the [[Canary Islands]], a smattering of rocks off the coast of Morocco, which they called the Fortunate Islands and from which they measured [[longitude]] - all points to the east. (Page 5)

**Note**: There doesn't seem to be any concrete evidence that these islands were used systematically by the Romans as a prime meridian for longitude measurements.

The concept of longitude was understood in a basic form by the Romans, but they lacked the precise methods to measure it accurately. Longitude is challenging to determine without accurate timekeeping technology.

And whilst Roman geographers like [[Ptolemy]] (though he's more Greek than Roman. He lived in Roman-ruled Egypt, but he and Egypt was culturally Greek) had theories about the Earth's geography, including ideas about longitude, these were based more on mathematical calculations and estimates rather than empirical measurements from a fixed reference point like the Canary Islands.

[[The Greeks]] did often have the meridian passing through the Canary Islands or through Alexandria as reference points in their geographical calculations. However, these were not universally adopted standards, and the methods were inconsistent.

So I guess *technically* they measured longitude from the Canary Islands. But it was mostly just theory. And wouldn't have been used for during actual sailing.

### Chinese banning shipbuilding

> The astonishing tribute fleets of the Ming were comparatively as advanced and as expensive as moon shots - each one cost half and they left as little behind the country's annual tax revenue as footprints in the lunar dust. In 1433, during the seventh expedition, Zheng He died, possibly at Calicut on the Indian coast. He was most likely buried at sea. After him, the star rafts never sailed again. The political current in [[China]] had changed: the emperors strengthened the [[Great Wall]] and shut themselves in. Ocean-going voyages were banned, all the records destroyed. In 1500 it became a capital offence to build a ship with more than two masts; fifty years later it was a crime even to put to sea in one. The technology of the star rafts vanished with Zheng He's body into the waters of the Indian Ocean; they left behind a power vacuum waiting to be filled. (Page 6)

**Note**: According to my GPT-4 research it wasn't a capital offence to build a ship with more than two masts. That appears to be wrong. However there was strict laws about shipbuilding (part of a broader policy known as the "haijin" (海禁)). And the penalties for violating these maritime restrictions were firm. You might be given the death penalty if you violated these laws *as well as* carried out piracy or treason.
