> This is not something, however, to which mere surround ings are conducive, unless the mind is at its own disposol able at will to provide its own seclusion even in crowd moments. On the contrary, the man who spends his tim choosing one resort after another in a hunt for peace and quiet, will in every place he visits find something to prevent bim from relaxing. The story is told that someone complained to Socrates that travelling abroad had never done him any good and received the reply: 'What else can you expect, seeing that you always take yourself along with you when you go abroad?' What a blessing it would be for some people if they could only lose themselves! As things are these persons are a worry and a burden, a source of demoralization and anxiety, to their own selves. What good does it do you to go overseas, to move from city to city? If you really want to escape the things that harass you, what you're needing is not to be in a different place but to be a different person. Suppose you've arrived in Athens, or suppose it's Rhodes - choose any country you like – what difference does the character of the place make? You'll only be importing your own with you. You'll still look on wealth as a thing to be valued: your poverty will be causing you torment, while (this being the most pathetic thing about it all) your poverty will be imaginary. However much there's someone else who has you possess more, and you'll be fancying yourself to be short of things you need to the exact extent to which you lag behind him. (Page 186)

> We, then, can show as spirited an attitude to just the same things if we will only choose to slip the yoke from our necks, But first we have to reject the life of pleasures; they make us soft and womanish; they are insistent in their demands, and what is more, require us to make insistent demands on fortune, And then we need to look down on wealth, which is the wage of slavery. Gold and silver and everything else that clutters our prosperous homes should be discarded. Freedom cannot be won without sacrifice. If you set a high value on her, everything else must be valued at little. (Page 194)

> To want simply what is enough nowadays suggests to people primitiveness and squalor.

> This is the company in which you must live out your days, Escape them you cannot, scorn them you can. And scorn them you will if by constant reflection you have anticipated future happenings. Everyone faces up more bravely to a thing for which he has long prepared himself, sufferings, even; being withstood if they have been trained for in advance. Those who are unprepared, on the other hand, are panicstricken by the most insignificant happenings. We must see to it that nothing takes us by surprise. And since it is invariably unfamiliarity that makes a thing more formidable than it really is, this habit of continual reflection will ensure that no form of adversity finds you a complete beginner.
