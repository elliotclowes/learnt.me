> It seems crystalclear that Ulysses S. Grant modeled himself after his mutely subdued mother, avoiding his father's bombast and internalizing her humility and self-control. The unflappable Hannah spoke in a low voice, never swore, and remained calm and sweet-tempered. She was kind and solicitous toward neighborhood children. One of Ulysses's friends remembered her as a woman of "deep feeling but not demonstrative," her reserve so resolute that she seldom joked and never laughed.¹5 Ulysses later praised her as "the best woman he had ever known; unselfish, devoted to her family, thoroughly good, conscientious, intelligent, of a quiet and amiable disposition, never meddling with other persons' affairs, genuinely pious without any cant, with a strong sense of right and justice.” He attributed his good sense and moral compass to her beneficent influence. Molded by her always dignified presence, Ulysses grew up with a deep, abiding respect for women and never treated them lightly or flirtatiously.

> Unlike her husband, Hannah doled out praise sparingly and recoiled from anything that faintly smacked of bragging. Even when her son grew famous, a journalist noted, "she not only refrained from boasting of him, but oftentimes blushed like a girl, and left the room when his praises were sounded in her ears; for it seemed akin to hearing self-praise."¹7 Hating mean-spirited gossip, she regarded others charitably and shrank from spiteful comments. One day, when women in her church group groused about a drunken husband in the congregation, Hannah chimed in: "Well, Mr. A. was a good fiddler, anyhow." 18 Hannah's tendency to trust people was a lesson that her innocent son Ulysses would learn almost too well. Despite her sterling traits, something was missing in Hannah Grant, a maternal warmth whose absence Ulysses felt keenly. "I never saw my mother cry," he claimed.¹ Deeply repressed, Hannah never bared her emotions or discussed them with her children. As she later told a reporter proudly, "We are not a demonstrative family."20 The Grants never showed affection openly and a curious distance always separated Ulysses S. Grant and his mother. In his Memoirs, he gave a fullblooded portrait of Jesse Grant's willful nature but, when it came to Hannah, he mentioned her maiden name but failed to endow her with a fully rounded personality. Jesse bursts from the page, while Hannah recedes and vanishes. However infuriating Ulysses found his father, he cared deeply about his opinion. With the emotionally arid Hannah, an enigmatic silence lingered and they had a constrained relationship in later years. This strange family background made Ulysses S. Grant a man who could seem emotionally blocked, although he freely poured forth his bottled-up feelings with his wife and children later on. (Page 6)

> Though never a smooth boy, skilled in social graces-he could be awkward and flustered in large groups-Ulysses exhibited a strict Methodist propriety. No dancing, card playing, or cursing was tolerated in the proper Grant household. “It has been a principle of mine never to swear at any time in my life," Ulysses attested in future years.38 Even as a raw country boy, he allowed himself no oath stronger than "Thunder and Lightning!" Once, when quarreling with an acquaintance, he was provoked to say "Darn." During the Civil War, Grant recounted this episode to someone who recalled him saying "that the very sound of the word to his ears bothered him, so that for an entire week it continued to literally haunt him."39 He spent a lifetime avoiding the coarse jokes and bawdy anecdotes that were commonplace in the military. "He revered women and thought such stories demeaned the female sex," said a cousin. "I have seen him freeze up a man instantly with a look when a vulgar story was told in his presence (Page 11)

> Impeccably polite and usually (but not always) neatly dressed, Ulysses reflected Hannah's prim parenting. He preferred innocent pastimes, such as swimming, playing marbles, or ice-skating. While he delighted in fishing barefoot in summer, seated by a brook near the tannery, he seldom hunted and derived no pleasure from the casual butchering of animals. "He was unusually sensitive to pain," said a friend, “and his aversion to taking any form of life was so great that he would not hunt."42 Such a tame boy inevitably became the butt of mockery, and Grant grew sensitive to public humiliation. Never one to initiate a fight, he refused to back down when bullied. He was roused to fury if sadistic boys tormented an innocent child or a defenseless horse, and smaller boys embraced him as their steadfast protector. On one occasion, Grant saw a big, oafish boy named Slifer picking on a much smaller boy. "Grant stepped forward, rolled up his sleeves, and told Slifer that he shouldn't fight that little fellow; that if there was any fighting to be done he could fight him,” said a cousin.4³ Grant never deviated from this philosophy, which he later applied to his eldest son. "I do not want him to feel afraid to pitch in when boys impose on him but he had better avoid boys who are inclined to quarrel.” (Page 12)

> Jesse Grant committed the common error of willful fathers who try to stimulate their sons and overpower them instead. He doted on his eldest boy, smothering him with attention and attempting to live vicariously through him. Reluctant to assert himself against his bossy father, Ulysses quietly resented the pressure to succeed, and Jesse was perplexed that his son "never seemed inclined to put himself forward at all; and was modest, retiring, and reticent. “Instead of accepting this, Jesse prodded the boy mercilessly at every turn. When he took Ulysses on a trip to eastern Ohio, a telling scene unfolded, recounted by a friend. “At this time Ulysses though young could read very well, of this his father was naturally very proud, and when they arrived at their destination, to his little son's dismay, he brought out a school reader, and telling his friends of how beautifully Ulysses could read, proceeded to open his book and requested him to read something, but Ulysses declined absolutely and stuck to it, to his father's chagrin and disappointment.'
>
> From this clash between grandstanding father and stubbornly private son, Ulysses developed a deeply entrenched modesty, "a particular aversion to egotists and braggarts," said a later colleague.5¹ He wanted people to discover his strengths, not have them advertised. Reluctant to flout his father openly, he developed a strategy of passive resistance, retreating behind a facade of silent obstinacy. He only stood up to his father indirectly, holding back his emotions, as if fearing their violent release. Torn between an intrusive father and a painfully retiring mother, he kept a world of buried feelings locked up inside. Even at the end of his life, one of his physicians delivered this judgment on his emotional makeup: "He is the most suppressive man I ever knew. He is not devoid of emotional nature, but his emotions from early life have been diverted from their natural channels of expression. What has been called imperturbability in him is simply introversion of his feelings." (Page 12)

> The major outlet for Grant's suppressed emotions was his rapturous love of horses. Hannah noted this special affinity: "Horses seem to understand Ulysses."53 Somewhat clumsy in his gait, the boy was surprisingly graceful on horseback. Riding horses was an ideal way to escape from the social complexities of home into a world where he enjoyed complete freedom and didn't have to kowtow to others. He liked to ride without a saddle or stirrups, sitting astride a blanket on the horse's back, and he was so expert at handling horses that he began riding at age five. He became known for breaking in wild horses for local farmers, a sight that drew admiring spectators to the village square. He tamed even the most refractory horses through a fine sensitivity to their nature rather than by his physical prowess. "If people knew how much more they could get out of a horse by gentleness than by harshness," Grant once observed, "they would save a great deal of trouble both to the horse and the man."
>
> For all his ingrained caution, the boy proved a daredevil on a horse, riding at top speed by age five while standing one-legged on its back. He would plant one foot on a sheepskin lashed to the animal, then maintain his balance by grasping the reins. Even when he was older and used a saddle, he had a startling way putting his left foot in the stirrup, grabbing the horse's mane with his left hand, then swinging his body nimbly over the horse in a single lithe, fluid motion. Perhaps no story better demonstrates his mastery of horses than Jesse's tale of when a circus came to town:
>
> > Once when [Ulysses] was a boy, a show came along in which thered was a mischievous pony, trained to go round the ring like lightning, and he was expected to throw any boy that attempted to ride him. "Will any boy come forward and ride this pony?" shouted the ring-master. Ulysses stepped forward, and mounted the pony. The performance began. Round and round and round the ring pony, faster and faster, making the greatest effort to dismount the rider. But Ulysses sat as steady as if he had grown to the to pony's back. Presently out came a large monkey and sprang up behind Ulysses. The people set up a great shout of laughter, and on the pony ran; but it all produced no effect on the rider. Then the ringmaster made the monkey jump on to Ulysses' shoulders, standing with his feet on his shoulders, and with his hands holding on to his hair. At this there was another and a still louder shout, but not a muscle of Ulysses' face moved. There was not a tremor of his nerves. A few more rounds and the ring-master gave it up; he had come across a boy that the pony and the monkey both could not dismount.55 (Page 13)

> The matter required a delicate next step. Jesse needed to write to his local congressman, Thomas Hamer, who had to nominate his son for West Point. There was time pressure involved: Hamer was a lame duck whose term ended March 4. Far more worrisome was that Jesse Grant and Thomas Hamer, quondam friends, had not spoken since they parted company over Jacksonian politics, when Jesse accused him of "gross deceit."68 Ulysses later said both men, regretting the breach, wanted a rapprochement. Jesse addressed a businesslike letter to Hamer, making no allusion to past unpleasantness. It reached Hamer the night of March 3 and, instead of being vindictive, he graciously agreed to submit Grant's name. In his haste, he listed the applicant as Ulysses S. Grant. The confusion came about either because Hamer confused Ulysses with his younger brother Simpson or because he assumed Ulysses was his first name and he had taken Hannah's maiden name for his middle name. (Grant himself blamed Senator Morris for the long-lived error.) The mistaken name, which persisted at West Point and beyond, was the bane of the young man's life and seemed symbolic of his almost comic passivity under Jesse's heavy-handed lage. As Grant later confessed to his wife in frank exasperation, "You know I have an 'S' in my name and don't know what it stand[s] for." (Page 17)

> “What a man he is! what a history! what an illustration-his life-of the capacities of that American individuality common to us all. Cynical critics are wondering "what the people can see in Grant" to make such a hubbub about. They aver . . . that he has hardly the average of our day's literary and scholastic culture, and absolutely no pronounc'd genius or conventional eminence of any sort. Correct: but he proves how an average western farmer, mechanic, boatman, carried by tides of circumstances, perhaps caprices, into a position of incredible military or civil responsibilities may steer his way fitly and steadily through them all, carrying the country and himself with credit year after year-command over a million armed men-fight more than fifty pitch'd battles-rule for eight years a land larger than all the kingdoms of Europe combined-and then, retiring, quietly (with a cigar in his mouth) make the promenade of the whole world, through its courts and coteries, and kings and czars and mikados... as phlegmatically as he ever walk'd the portico of a Missouri hotel after dinner. . . . Seems to me it transcends Plutarch. How those old Greeks, indeed, would have seized on him! A mere plain man-no art, no poetry. . . A common trader, money-maker, tanner, farmer of Illinoisgeneral for the republic ... in the war of attempted secession-President following, (a task of peace, more difficult than the war itself)-nothing heroic, as the authorities put it and yet the greatest hero. The gods, the destinies, seem to have concentrated upon him.”

> Terrified that if he died he would leave Julia destitute, Grant agreed to pen his memoirs and relive his glory days of battle. As seen in his wartime orders, he had patented a lean, supple writing style, and a crisp narrative now flowed in polished sentences, honed by the habits of a lifetime. Words poured from this supposedly taciturn man, showing how much thought and pent-up feeling lay beneath his tightly buttoned facade. He wrote in an overstuffed leather armchair, his outstretched legs swaddled by blankets, resting on a facing chair. He wore a wool cap over thick brown hair now streaked with gray, a shawl draped over his shoulders, and a muffler around his neck concealing a tumor the size of baseball.

> Seldom, if ever, has a literary masterpiece been composed under such horrific circumstances. Whenever he swallowed anything, Grant was stricken with pain and had to resort to opiates that clouded his brain. As a result, he endured extended periods of thirst and hunger as he labored over his manuscript. The torment of the inflamed throat never ceased. When the pain grew too great, his black valet, Harrison Terrell, sprayed his throat with "cocaine water," temporarily numbing the area, or applied hot compresses to his head. Despite his fear of morphine addiction, Grant could not dispense entirely with such powerful medication. "I suffer pain all the time, except when asleep," he told his doctor. Although bolstered by analgesics, Grant experienced only partial relief, informing a reporter that "when the suffering was so intense... he only wished for the one great relief to all human pain.'
>
> Summoning his last reserves of strength, through a stupendous act of willpower, Grant toiled four to six hours a day, adding more time on sleepless nights.
>
> For family and friends his obsessive labor was wondrous to behold: the soldier so famously reticent that someone quipped he "could be silent in several languages"
>
> pumped out 336,000 words of superb prose in a year.7 By May 1885, just two months before his death, Grant was forced to dictate, and, when his voice failed, he scribbled messages on thin strips of paper. Always cool in a crisis, Grant exhibited the prodigious stamina and granite resolve of his wartime effort.

> Nobody was more thunderstruck than Samuel Clemens, aka Mark Twain, who had recently formed a publishing house with his nephew-in-law Charles Webster. To snare Grant's memoirs, sure to be a literary sensation, Twain boosted the royalty promised by the Century's publishers and won the rights. Twain had never seen a writer with Grant's gritty determination. When this man “under sentence of death with that cancer" produced an astonishing ten thousand words in one day, Twain exclaimed, "It kills me these days to write half of that." He was agog when Grant dictated at one sitting a nine-thousand-word portrait of Lee's surrender at Appomattox "never pausing, never hesitating for a word, never XX INTRODUCTION repeating and in the written-out copy he made hardly a correction." Twain, who considered the final product a masterwork, scoffed at scuttlebutt he had ghostwritten it. "There is no higher literature than these modern, simple Memoirs,” he insisted. “Their style is flawless ... no man can improve upon it." 10 For Twain, the revelation of Grant's character was as startling as his storytelling. Eager to spare his family, Grant was every inch the stoic gentleman. Only at night, when he was asleep, did his face grimace with pain. "The sick-room brought out the points of General Grant's character," Twain wrote. "His exceeding gentleness, kindness, forbearance, lovingness, charity. .
>
> . He was the most lovable great child in the world."¹¹ For one observer, it was wrenching to watch Grant "with a bandage about his aching head, and a horrible and mortal disease clutching his throat." He felt "a great ache when I look at him who had saved us all when we were bankrupt in treasure and in leaders, and see him thus beset by woes and wants. "12 In a magnificent finale, Grant finished the manuscript on July 16, 1885, one week before his death in upstate New York. He had steeled himself to stay alive until the last sentence was done and he could surrender his pen.

> Perhaps the most explosively persistent myth about Grant is that he was a “drunkard,” with all that implies about self-indulgence and moral laxity. Modern science has shown that alcoholism is a "chronic disease," not a "personal failing as it has been viewed by many." "24 Because Grant's drinking has been scrutinized in purely moralistic terms, his admirers have felt the need to defend him from the charge as vigorously as detractors have rushed to pin it on him. The drinking issue, both real and imaginary, so permeated Grant's career that a thoroughgoing account is needed to settle the matter. This biography will contend that Grant was an alcoholic with an astonishingly consistent pattern of drinking, recognized by friend and foe alike: a solitary binge drinker who would not touch a drop of alcohol, then succumb at three- or four-month intervals, usually on the road. As a rule, he underwent a radical personality change and could not stop himself once he started to imbibe. Alcohol was not a recreation selfishly indulged, but a forbidden impulse against which he struggled for most of his life. He joined a temperance lodge in early adulthood and lent the movement open support in later years. While drinking almost never interfered with his official duties, it haunted his career and trailed him everywhere, an infuriating, ever-present ghost he could not shake. It influenced how people perceived him and deserves close attention. As with so many problems in his life, Grant managed to attain mastery over alcohol in the long haul, a feat as impressive as any of his wartime victories.
