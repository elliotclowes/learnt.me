> Bread, milk, butter, cheese, beef and a good mug of beer were the staples of the seventeenth-century English diet. (Page 30)

> John Winthrop applied the same reasoning that the English used to justify their colonisation of Ireland, arguing that because they 'inclose noe Land, neither have they any setled habytation, nor any tame Cattle to improve the Land by', they had not earned the right to own the land. The English settlers in America were, he argued, performing a Christian duty by taming the American wilderness.
> […] The Native Americans were cast as versions of the barbarous Irish, who had forfeited their right to the country by their failure to properly order the landscape and realise its potential. (Page 31)

> After American independence it became a central tenet of American politics that it was the role of government to protect the citizen's right to live an independent and selfsufficient life on a farmstead. This way of thinking still permeates American republicanism today. (Page 40)

> The world centre of sugar manufacture had gradually moved from northern India to the Levant in the early medieval period, and by the fifteenth century Cyprus and Sicily were Europe's main suppliers. But when the Portuguese discovered the Azores in 1427 and Madeira in 1455, they found that the climate of these Atlantic islands was better suited to growing sugar than the Mediterranean, and when they took Brazil in the 1540s, they expanded production into their new colony. One hundred years later, as Portugal's position as the pre-eminent European maritime power was on the wane, the Dutch West India Company seized control of the Brazilian sugar plantations as well as Portugal's slave-trading forts dotted along the West African coastline. Dutch vessels now criss-crossed the Atlantic Ocean, bringing African slaves to work on the plantations, and returning laden down with huge cargoes of sugar destined for Antwerp's refineries. Drax and his associates would have been aware of this trade, and it was reportedly a Dutch visitor to Barbados who persuaded him and some other planters to try their hands at cultivating this potentially lucrative crop.

> Thus the Africa the Europeans encountered was not a backward continent where they were able to simply impose their will. When they arrived looking for slaves, they were tapping into an established trade. Indeed, slavery was integral to the fabric of African society and slaves were not necessarily treated as mere chattels. Usually captured in a raid, they were put to work growing crops for the nobility on plantations, mining gold, carrying goods along trading routes, weaving cloth, pounding millet and cooking food. But they also occupied trusted positions within the households of African kings and nobles, acting as administrators, guards and warriors. In the villages, they were often assimilated into the community, caring for children, working in the fields and processing and preparing food alongside the free women of the family." Englishmen stationed on the island of Gorée at the mouth of the Gambia River in the 1770s and 1780s remarked that it was 'impossible to distinguish the [slaves] from free men'.
> Those slaves who were surplus to requirements had since the twelfth century been transported across the Sahara Desert to the Muslim world around the Mediterranean basin. Now the insatiable demand for a steady stream of miserable captives to feed the maws of the European slave ships created a burgeoning new market. It was the fate of 12-15 million Africans to be sold into the Atlantic slave trade. With the arrival of the Europeans, West Africa was inexorably drawn into the Atlantic economy. (Page 63)

> In the eighteenth century, the English, Scots and Welsh were united into a single state and began to define themselves as British. This new identity derived from a sense of a shared Protestantism, which was highlighted by their opposition to Catholic France. With the British triumph over the French in Canada and India during the Seven Years War (1756-63), public pride in Britain's navy and imperial strength grew. Victories at sea were now marked by the ringing of church bells, and there was a populist dimension to the celebration of empire - merchants, artisans, people in the provinces all took pride in Britain's overseas triumphs. National morale was affected by imperial success (or failure). And Britain's military might was financed by its empire. In the 1760s, the duty the government made on sugar imports was roughly equivalent to the cost of maintaining all the ships in the British navy. More directly, the government raised loans from the East India Company to finance its wars. The consumption of colonial goods became linked to pride in Britain's imperial greatness, and both became an integral part of what it meant to be British. (Page 92)

> Tea sweetened with sugar eventually displaced beer as the primary drink of the poor. Tea itself does not seem an obvious alternative to beer until the sweetness of the eighteenth-century brew is taken into account: the amount of malt it contained would have produced a heady, sweet beer that may have predisposed people to develop a liking for strong, sugary tea.
