> Alexandre Dumas's classic swashbuckling tale The Three Musketeers has often been filmed, but never so wonderfully as Richard Lester's 1973 version. It began life as a possible film vehicle for The Beatles; instead it turned into an all-star epic featuring the likes of Charlton Heston, Faye Dunaway, Michael York, Christopher Lee and Raquel Welch. Oliver Reed was perfect casting as Athos but his extreme nature caused problems when it came to the numerous sword fight sequences. Reed didn't bother much with rehearsals and went hell for leather when the cameras rolled, so much so that the 40-strong stunt team drew lots to determine who would fight him. Such exuberance impinged on his costars, too. 'Oliver did nothing by halves,' notes Christopher Lee. 'I remember during a fight scene he came at me with both hands on the sword, like an axe, and I parried it and stopped totally. I said, â€œI think we'd better get the routine right." Then I said to Oliver, "Do you remember who taught you how to use a sword?" He said, "You did." And I said, "Don't forget it." You see I made Devil Ship Pirates with him for Hammer and he was a bit of a menace in that, quite frankly. People leapt out of the way when he had a fight, because he went at it absolutely flat out.'

> The Spanish fight arranger on the film was so unprepared to be charged at the moment Lester shouted 'Action' that he came close to throwing up with fear and refused to go near Reed again. 'Oliver sometimes would go totally berserk and start to really fight 100 per cent real,' recalls producer Ilya Salkind.

> 'And we'd have to say, "Oliver, it's just a movie." Finally Oliver got a sword through his wrist. I guess one of the stunt men wasn't happy with him, because he was always going at them like a maniac.' Unfortunately this 'accidental' stab wound landed Ollie in hospital for four days with blood poisoning. He lay in bed receiving blood transfusions as the ever-dependable Reg Prince smuggled spaghetti dinners in at night through the window.

> Ollie's madcap sword fighting style was later to bring praise from an unlikely source, that of director Quentin Tarantino. 'Oliver Reed is just fucking GOD in this movie. During the fight training Reed threw himself into the fighting so much he made all the other musketeers work twice as hard. They knew if they didn't, Reed was going to own the movie completely. He was that good. You've never seen sword fights the way Reed fights them in this movie.'
