> With bread as the basic element of dinner, what of the other food? While the aristocracy dined upon roasted meats and fish the of a bewildering array, for everyone else pottage was most common dish, and the most varied. The word simply meant a stew cooked in a pot and thickened with a grain or pulse of some sort. As the seasons changed, all manner of fruit, vegetables and herbs made their appearance within the pottage. When the hens were laying and the cows were in milk, eggs, milk, cream and butter would have thickened and enriched the mix, too. The Christian tradition of fasting - abstaining from meat, eggs and dairy products on both a daily and a seasonal basis- meant that fish and shellfish often flavoured pottages on Fridays, Saturdays, Wednesdays, Lent and Advent, and a host of different meats provided further variety on other days. Some recipes were simple and cheap, such as pease pottage, where dried peas were soaked and then simmered in water with a bit of ham or bacon and a handful of mint, while others could be expensive-complex and subtle mixtures of chicken, lemon, wine and for eggs, example, with a pinch of ginger and finely chopped dates and capers. Many of Britain's traditional regional dishes are Tudor pottages, from cullen skink in Scotland to lamb cawl in Wales. Scotch broth, pea and ham soup, cock-a-leekie, kale brose and hodge-podge: the list goes on and on. The basic method was to start with some good stock, add meat if you had any, or hish ir it was not a meat-eating day, then the grain or pulses and herbs, and simmer for a good long time, throwing more herbs ane vegetables in towards the end of the cooking. It required very little tending or complex preparation, so could be fitted around other work. It didn't matter too much if the fire died down for a while, so there was no need to be stuck next to pot watching it. Popping in and out of the kitchen was enough. The same method was effective with any number of ingredients, whatever you had to hand. The end product is both filling and delicious.

> It was a summer dish because of the two meats used. Both veal and pork were available from late spring to early summer but were harder to obtain the rest of the year. Most of us are at least vaguely aware of the seasonality of fruit and vegetables. But within the Tudor world all foodstuffs had their season. Hens did not lay during the winter (we use artificial light to stimulate them into laying all year round), and cows had a dry period from late September through to the spring, when they were between calves. Supplementary feeding and artificial insemination give us our year-round milk supplies. With almost all calves born in the spring, veal was a very seasonal meat. Pork is best from young pigs, so is once again a meat of late spring, while bacon and ham are usually from more mature animals and were produced later in the year. Mutton is most economically slaughtered just after the annual shearing in June, and geese can be fattened for table when 'green' in early summer when the is growing strongly, or 'stubble fed' at Michaelmas when they have grazed on the stubble after harvest. The fish in our oceans follow their own seasonal migration patterns, arriving at our farmer, grass shores on cue at the same times each year.
