> A baker called George Barlow died in 1584. He knew he was dying; his will had been made the year before, on 26 July 1583. He probably knew because he had a cough that wouldn't go away; he probably knew he had baker's lung, caused by inhaling particles of flour every single day. He would never make old bones; most bakers didn't live long lives. He left few possessions: a bakehouse, a bolting tub, a kneading trough, and other treen ware, literally tools and utensils made from trees. He also had a vital supply of fuel; its importance is shown by its presence in his inventory. He had gorse kindlings, or kiddes, and wood kiddes, turves and coals.¹ George's pathetic inventory shows how hard the life of a baker was, trapped in harsh working conditions. To discover where daily bread came from and what it cost, we must visit the infernal deep of the pre-industrial baker's daily round; for the baker, hours in hell, and for the baker's boy, all night forever, below ground. The history of food should not begin with what is on the table. It should begin with those who make the food (Page 27)

> The result is starkly visible in the archaeological record: average male height, having risen from 165cm to 172cm between the Mesolithic and the early medieval period, fell to 171cm; Britons had become taller under Roman occupation, their average height increasing from 167cm to 170cm. This coincided with the Romans' improved water supply and sanitation systems and a more varied diet. Height decreased from 600 AD and then began to climb again, increasing to 173cm in the 1100s, very close to average heights in the twentieth century. But after 1200, men became shorter in stature, and archaeological evidence shows that at this time rural populations were decreasing, farmland had become degraded and there were shortages of crop seeds as temperatures turned colder over the century, with weather becoming far more changeable until the early 1300s. Height decreased again after 1650, reaching just 169cm in the late 1600s - a decline that continued until the early 1800s. Average life expectancy declined too, as infant mortality soared; people born between 1650 and 1750 could expect to live just thirty-five years - down from forty years in the late 1500s. (Page 46)

> Reading seventeenth-century recipes, one is struck by how dark people's taste was - dark, slow-cooked meats, especially old meats like mutton, game and offal; rich spicing; heavy wine and meat-based sauces; relatively few salads or vegetables. They had a taste for sourness or bitterness, as in the nowadays-none-too-edible tansies they ate, and the frequent use of vinegar. Palates were really intense. Added to which, they were drinking a lot of very strong ale strong in both senses and also wine that had been spiced and sugared. (Page 51)

> Bread could reveal occult secrets: if a loaf of bread over-rose and many very large holes, it meant the woman of the family was pregnant. Every crumb had to be carefully swept up, and thrown forth as food for some of God's creatures. It was believed that anyone guilty of casting bread into the fire, or in any way destroying it, would sooner or later be hungry. If a young woman was in the habit of burning bread when baking, the saying was: 'Never marry the lass,/ It [that] burns the bread or spills the meal,/ She'll ne'er do well t' child nor chiel [man]'. A woman should not sing while she was baking, or she would shed tears before the bread was eaten.
>
> Because the transformation going on behind the closed oven door remained mysterious, bread-making was itself ritualised. Seventeenthcentury folklorist John Aubrey wrote that when the Bread was put in the oven, they prayed to God and Saint Stephen, to send them a just batch and even', a prayer that reflects the likelihood that something could go wrong. An understanding of bread as porous to death was manifest in other beliefs: 'Bread will not rise when there is a dead body in the house'; 'A hole in the newly-cut loaf signified a grave'. Bread also had curative and prophylactic properties. Bread hung around a baby's neck was believed to keep the fairies away. Loaves that joined together during baking signified a wedding, and separating them over the head of a tongue-tied child would cure it by sympathetic magic.
>
> Barm or liquid yeast was called Goddisgood, yet in folklore such good' names are most often ambiguous; it was almost as if a blessing was needed to make it behave, as with the fairies, usually called the good people or the good neighbours to defray any possible wrath. And yet, though bewitchment of ale was common, breadmaking was seldom bewitched. Indeed, eating bread could cure bewitchment. (Page 53)

> Henry Mayhew says in London Labour and the London Poor that a man with a rich musical voice sold Chelsea buns all year round in Westminster, crying: 'One a penny, two a penny, hot Chelsea buns! Burning hot! Smoking hot! R-r-r-reeking hot! Hot Chelsea buns!'
>
> The 'Chelsea' in the bun was important. Buns began to announce their locality. The Bath bun arrived, not necessarily in Bath, along with its fellow, the Sally Lunn, and its attendant romantic fictions about Huguenot refugees; it was accompanied by the Yorkshire cake, the Eccles cake, the Kentish huffkin and the Goosnargh cake, the Colston bun from Bristol and the Wood Street Cake from the City of London. The last-named, a lightly yeasted fruitcake with rosewater icing, was marketed with a royal story, relating that when in 1648 Lady Anne Halkett helped smuggle the future James II from London into Europe dressed as a woman, she gave him a Wood Street Cake for the journey, for she knew he loved the cakes. The story illustrates the kind of pedigree being claimed for the new baked goods- old and very posh. (Page 54)

> In Wiltshire, however, a new law of 1766 made it a crime to take wood, with punishments including flogging. Rights to gather wood were lost. Self-sufficiency was not only a question of access to arable land but also about the right to gather fuel; a major cause of rural misery was that by 1800 most labourers' houses had no fire at all, not even for the provision of light and heat. (Page 58)

> People associated dark bread with poverty. They wanted bread that was whiter than white. Painter William Hogarth wrote impatiently in 1753, 'They eat no Bread of Wheat and Rye, but ... as white as any Curd. Meanwhile, a free and rather red-top kind of press gave vent to fresh scandals blaming bakers: 'There is another ingredient, which is more shocking to the heart and if possible more hurtful to the health of mankind' - 'sacks of old ground bones', scavenged from charnel houses. "Thus the charnel houses of the dead are raked to add filthiness to the food of the living. Whether true or false, the tale was of a piece with the public's view of bakers. Not only were they incendiary cheats, they were dirty too. In the midst of nineteenth-century progress economic liberalism, Charles Astridge remembered the bread he and his family were forced to eat: 'We mostly lived on bread, but it wasn't bread like ee [you] get now; twas that heavy and doughy ee could pull long strings of it out of your mouth. They called it gravy bread. But twas fine compared with the porridge we made out of bruised beans. (Page 60)

> And bread was 'that damp you had to dig it out o' the middle with a spoon'. Or as another memoir recalled, in wet summers, a slice, when cut, if pulled apart, was as though cobwebby, the colour then black, and it stank'.68 What was wrong with the bread was rope spores, aka Bacillus mesenticus or pumilus or subilis, a bread spoilage organism which especially affects the bread crumb, particularly at the centre of the loaf, leaving behind a sticky, pasty, stringy mass. It also smells exotically of pineapple. The cause was the wheat becoming wet prior to harvest and/or being harvested in a wet state, a frequent occurrence in wet years. Rope spores survive the baking process, germinate, and make the menacing cobwebs Astridge recalled. Nowadays, nobody in England would eat the horrible result.

> This was the era of the Corn Laws. In the early nineteenth century, during the Napoleonic Wars, it had not been possible to import from Europe. This led to an expansion of British wheat farming and to high grain prices, which led inexorably to high bread prices Landowners were encouraged to grow wheat on every tiny scrap of land, under fences and below gates and stiles. It was a boom time for landowners. And like all booms, it had a use-by date. The wars ended. with Napoleon's defeat at Waterloo in 1815. Grain could be imported from the Continent once more, and the price of wheat fell sharply, from 126s 6d a quarter (8 bushels) in 1812, to 65s 7d three years later.
>
> Landowners applied pressure to Parliament, and Parliament - largely of landowners- responded by passing a law permitting the import of foreign wheat free of duty only when the domestic price reached 80s. per quarter. During the passing of this legislation, the Houses of Parliament had to be defended by armed troops against a huge crowd, who knew full well that the law would mean that the staple of their diet, bread, would become unaffordable. With lower prices, farmers planted less wheat. There was a dreadful harvest in 1816. Bread prices shot back up. This was followed by industrial action as workers demanded higher wages in order to pay the increased food prices. As well as strikes, there were food riots all over Britain.
>
> Protests against the Corn Laws were one of the objects of a peaceful gathering of workers at a place called St Peter's Field in Manchester on 16 August 1819, leading to the Peterloo massacre. (Page 60)

> Bread is all that stands between the vulnerable and starvation. Not even Charles Dickens understood just how bad it could really be. At bottom of society, a week's food looked like this:
>
> > Fried bacon. Bread. Sugary tea. Cold pork and boiled potatoes for lunch. Bread, butter, and tea. Bread, cheese and a glass of beer.
>
> This diet of a very poor widow in the nineteenth century makes frightening reading. On Tuesday, a treat was in store: afternoon tea consisted of bread and butter, with jam. The bread, notably, was eaten fresh on Monday and Tuesday, toasted from Wednesday to Saturday; by then it would have been stale if the widow had bought a single loaf on Monday. But at dinner every day she had bread rather than toast, probably because toast required a fire. ¹30 Why were Tuesdays her treat days? Did the staling bread by then need jam as a pick-me-up? Did the nameless widow check the bread every day to see if today was the day for jam? Very new bread is too soft for jam; it goes soggy.
>
> Elderly single women were the poorest of the poor. One poor woman in mid-nineteenth century Wiltshire had four gallons of bread, made from the wheat she raised and ground herself, with 1/2 lbs cheese, and she looked back on this as the good old days. After her husband died, she and her son had only 1/2 gallons of bread, 14 lb butter, tea, and some sugar. She also had some potatoes. Bread, potatoes and tea dominated the diets of the poor. Dominated means that often enough, that was all there was. The food of the poor did vary from place to place; in Lincolnshire it was better than in Wiltshire, and labourers had bacon every day, sugar and treacle. They ate more and more varied vegetables too. Yet even there 'the women say they live on tea; they have tea three times a day, with sop bread, and treacle'.
>
> Husbands and grownup children held mothers to a standard beyond their resources; mothers could only respond by giving their portion to everyone else. On Thursdays and Fridays, even comfortably off mothers ate bread and butter. A Poplar woman ended the week with a kettle of crusts with hot water, pepper, salt and a knob of bender, a cup margarine. Joseph Williamson described his mother:
>
> > How my mother existed is a mystery. I am reminded of the Lord saying 'I have meat ye know not of.' She would sit at table watching us eat, and she would make little balls of dry bread and put them in her mouth. One of us would urge her, 'Have some dinner, Mother,' and she would reply quite cheerfully, I'll have mine presently.
>
> 'Women's hunger was unmentionable and self-starvation common. A Barnsbury couple in 1876 pawned their children's shoes to get Sunday dinner. The rural poor might by Friday be eating boiled bacon, greens, potato, apple dumpling (the husband) or bread, butter, cake, hot tea (mother and child). (Page 96)

> The word food suggests something solid. However, human beings also need liquid, and liquids have always formed part of our diet. For centuries, beer was prominent in the English diet. The beer of the Anglo-Saxons was a sweet, heavy and dark-coloured drink without hops as a flavouring, also known as ale. When hops were introduced in the fifteenth century, ousting other complex herbal flavourings, beer came to mean specifically the bitter substance they flavoured, with ale retained as a broader category. Beer was consumed at every meal; Elizabeth I drank it for breakfast, and the Earl of Northumberland and his wife drank two pints of beer and wine every day at their first meal. Even the Earl's two young sons were allowed two quarts of beer, though no wine, while his children in the nursery received one quart each. A maid of honour at Henry VIII's court received eight pints of ale at breakfast, dinner and supper every day. It has been suggested that it's impossible to consume this much beer, but there is no evidence that it was wasted. The beer and the ale would have been very alcoholic, much like artisanal beer today; when we think of medieval and early modern foods, it's important to remember that these would have been taken at meals alongside the strong, treacly, and sometimes bitter or sour flavour of real ale. Such tastes primed the nation to enjoy the equally deep and dark flavours of game. Sometimes, ale or beer might be warmed with spices, including sugar. In apple-growing areas, cider too played a role, but this remained mainly local.
>
> Consumption was not moderate; under Edward I, a statute required London taverns to close by curfew, and under the Tudors, increased fears of unrest led in 1552 to the first licensing act (although drunkenness was blamed on riotous soldiers returning from wars in the Low Countries). A visitor to England in 1598 reported that 'beer is the general drink and excellently well tasted, but strong and what fuddles'.¹ Many devout Puritans felt that ale distracted people from what really mattered: in 1617, Thomas Young complained angrily about those who 'go 10 times to an alehouse, before they go once to a church'.
>
> Ale played a surprisingly large role in the life of medieval parishes. Instead of having cake sales, parishes raised money through ale sales; like the cakes, the ale was made by the wives of the parish for feast days, which were called church ales. It was these to which later Puritans objected. In general, however, ale-making was a surprisingly respectafor women to earn a living; because the mastery of ale-making was a key part of the housewife's role, it could be continued into commerce without violating ideas about women's place. As this implies, most ale was made at home, and consumed at home even if purchased elsewhere. There were pubs, but in medieval England these were not as prominent as they were later to become. The Tabard Inn in Chaucer's Canterbury Tales is a novelty to the pilgrims;³ it was more usual for pilgrims to take advantage of monastic obligations to provide hospitality, and of churches' church ales. The alehouse and its predominance are products of the Reformation. Because the monasteries were destroyed, and because church ales were abandoned in many areas due to Puritan opposition, the public house came into existence to replace both, offering accommodation and conviviality in place of the monasteries, and ale in place of church ale sales.
>
> But the heyday of the pub was brief. In the post-Restoration world, it was challenged by other kinds of liquids sold in other kinds of places. In one of the largest changes ever to take place in the English diet, beer was replaced with remarkable rapidity- by coffee, tea, hot chocolate - and the joker in the pack, gin. Not only was this, in the case of tea and coffee, a shift to a range of stimulants whose principal appeal lay in the caffeine they contained and the sugar used to sweeten them, it was also a shift from local grain to exotic imported substances. Not one of the new beverages was an English invention, not even gin; all of them, however, became essential elements of the English diet, reflecting the growth of England's mercantile trading empire and the criticality of its trade routes (Page 99)

> When William Harvey, discoverer of the circulation of the blood, died in 1657, he left £56 worth of coffee to the London College of Physicians, with the instruction that his colleagues should meet monthly and drink to commemorate his death. (Page 102)

> “Let it ever be remembered, that it is the direct influence of commerce to make the interval between the richest and the poorest man wider and more unconquerable.” – Shelley (Page 129)

> The ultimate lunch is Christmas dinner; it is still called that, and still takes place in the middle of the day. Perhaps it is really the last, stubborn survivor of the old midday dinner. […] Sunday dinner was like Christmas dinner in little. Families would splurge to buy the breadwinner a bit of meat with potatoes, the best and largest joint the housewife could afford so that the remains of it could form midday lunches in the week. (Page 202)

***

> For most, the Victorian midday meal was anything but elegant. It usually consisted of leftover roast meat, beef or mutton, eked out with potatoes, plain bread, and sometimes a pudding. Children's midday meal was especially dull, for it was economically sensible as well as nutritionally wise to take the dinner leftovers, cook them again, and serve them in the nursery. This led to some cute names like bubble and squeak, toad in the hole and eggs in the nest, but the results were fatty and almost unbearably solid. Plain and wholesome food was understood as easier to digest, especially for children, whose digestions could be ruined, Victorians felt, by too many condiments… (Page 203)

> Reproduction begins earlier when dietary needs are met - the average age of menarche, the first menstrual period, has been dropping since the Second World War, pointing to a much more adequate general diet. Menarche happens when body weight reaches 100 lb. Over the past two centuries the average age at which a typical British girl starts puberty has fallen from around fourteen to closer to ten. Most of that change is due to better health and improved diet and living tions, but over the past twenty years the trend has accelerated, thanks in the main to burgeoning levels of childhood obesity - overweight girls tend to mature faster. (Page 216)

> One aspect of the loss of forms of knowledge like foraging is the lost awareness of seasonality, in which the appearance of one plant quietly heralds the search for another. This should not necessarily be an object of nostalgia; our urban obliviousness to seasons is an outcome of plenty. Once, seasonality was impossible to ignore: it beat in the belly as hunger. In northern Europe, there are two main seasons for foraging, located on either side of the peak grain harvest like bookends. One is in spring, before the green wheat is certain to survive; the other is in autumn, after the harvest has been gathered in, the time for hedgerow fruit and mushrooms. Historians who describe pottagebased diets as dreary or monotonous know nothing of foraging and its power to infuse the grain or pulse with colour and scent and variety - and vitamins and minerals too. A pearl barley soup with some meat stock or a few morsels of bacon, or plain water, using a bit of lard or bacon fat to fry up an onion, with whatever greens you find. Any kind of pottage (aka risotto), or any egg dish (nettle frittata, or soufflé), and also burdock, chickweed and good king Henry (which has no claim on our attention as a comment on Henry VIII, but is so-called simply to distinguish it from bad king Henry, which is poisonous), cow parsley, hairy bittercress (handily on a six-week growth cycle), horseradish, land cress, pennywort, ground elder, dead nettle, white yarrow: they add colour, taste, vitamins, minerals and freshness. Anyone who assumes the diet of the poor was a mush of tasteless grains should head out into a hedgerow or neglected garden in early April with a basket and a pair of scissors. (Page 218)

> Jane Grigson notes that the French continue to make a cheese called caillebotte au chardonette, using cardoons as rennet. 16 You place the thistle flower in a muslin bag and steep it in the milk. It works much better in goat's or sheep's milk than it does in cow's milk; my one effort to use it to make curds in very fresh raw cow milk was a failure. But it still represents a plant most of us see as a mere nuisance. **Perhaps a good definition of nuisance is something whose use we've forgotten.** (Page 220)

> Virginia Woolf, on the other hand, was in the 1920s treated, if that is the right word, by the then recommended regime of complete rest not even books were allowed, lest they excite the brain - milk, weight gain, fresh air and early nights. One of her doctors, Sir George Savage, was especially keen to treat neurasthenic women by excessive feeding and complete rest. Woolf was given four or five pints of milk every day, half a pint every two hours. After five days of milk on this scale, she was allowed to add a cutlet, malt extract, cod liver oil and beef tea. The rather brainless thinking behind the regime was that since patients like Woolf stopped eating and lost weight when depressed, they could be forced back into wellness by being made to gain weight.
