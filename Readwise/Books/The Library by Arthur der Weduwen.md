> Print also represented a decisive fork in the road in one orher respect, for the vibrant manuscript cultures of Africa, the Middle East and East Asia did not follow Europe in embracing the mass production of print. The Ottoman Empire largely eschewed altogether. The unhappy Venetian who presented to the Sublime Porte the first printed copy of the Qur'an was condemned for blasphemy. (Page 6)

> The planting of a Greek city on the northern coast of Egypt played a key role in the expansive imperial vision of Alexander the Great, though he did not live to see the creation of the great seaport or its library. This was the achievement of the first two Ptolemaic kings, the dynasty born of Ptolemy the First, who secured Egypt when Alexander's empire was carved up among his leading generals. The library of Alexandria was first and foremost a scholarly academy: the rapidly developing collection of texts was essentially their research archive. Scholars who agreed to join the community in Egypt received benefits few academics could even dream of: a lifetime appointment, with a handsome salary, exemption from tax and free food and lodging. Among those tempted by these blandishments were the scientists Euclid, Strabo and Archimedes. From these names we can judge that the Ptolemies furnished their library not only with the classics of literature, but serious texts in the fields of mathematics, geography, physics and medicine. The acquisitions was dazzling. Agents travelled throughout pace the Greek territories purchasing books on an industrial scale. Less creditably, scrolls were forcibly removed for copying from any ship entering the port. Many ships' captains would have needed to continue their before the originals were returned. (Page 20)

> The treatment of animal skins to make sheets for writing was a long-established practice. The name derived from the Greek city of Pergamum, which is credited with having developed the technique of soaking, scraping and stretching skins to create a surface for writing. Yet parchment was not widely used in the ancient world, relied upon only during shortages of papyrus. In an era of abundant and cheap papyrus, this is understandable: parchment took longer to prepare and was far more expensive: a substantial parchment book would require the skins of more than a hundred calves, goats or sheep. But it did have two advantages: it was durable and would not degrade in climates colder than that of the Egyptian Nile delta, and one could write on both sides of the sheet, instead of the single side of papyrus. (Page 35)

> Collecting the best books required an extensive network of like-minded friends: we have already met Poggio Bracciolini and Niccolò de' Niccoli, who corresponded extensively about their quest for lost manuscripts.7 While Bracciolini was a notorious book hunter, it was Niccoli who was the collector, building one of the finest libraries of his day without leaving Florence. Niccoli devoted his life and his entire fortune to his library, assembling some 800 manuscripts. Far from keeping these books out of the public eye, he freely invited scholars, friends and interested citizens to study, discuss and admire his books; he even lent them out, to the extent that 200 of his books were out of his home at his death in 1437. (Page 63)

> Niccoli in particular was renowned for his innovative humanistic script, which would later inspire the design of italic or cursive type. This allowed the pen to move more rapidly over the page, creating greater efficiency in copying. (Page 63)

> Less than a year after Aeneas Piccolomini marvelled at the wonders of the Gutenberg Bible, its printer was in deep trouble. Gutenberg was embroiled in a court case with his erstwhile partner, Johann Fust, who had provided much of the finance for the 'work of the books, and who accused Gutenberg of owing him 2,026 guilders, enough money to buy twenty large houses in Mainz. Although the legal wrangle would ultimately demonstrate that Gutenberg owed only about half this amount, this debt was enough to ruin him financially.? The stark warning that a successful printer had to keep a shrewd eye on his purse would be lost on many of Gutenberg’s successors in the trade. In the fifty years after Gutenberg printed his Bible, at least a thousand printers would at some point cot lish premises in one of 240 towns scattered around Europe. Many of them were active for only a few years; few found riches. (Page 76)

> Auctions helped collectors build their libraries more quickly and with a clear conscience. Collectors are always greedy, sometimes unscrupulous and often selfish. Auctions not only provided huge new opportunities to buy, but also allowed collectors to sale their conscience with the thought that their heirs could easily realise the value of their books after their death. This was indeed the case. Books seem to have held their value remarkably well, and often sold for much the same prices for which they were purchased twenty or thirty years before.3 Sometimes they would go for a higher price, particularly if the owner had had them elegantly bound. A doctor or minister could invest in a desired title, secure in the knowledge that his grieving widow and children would quickly recover the money spent: all the more so as auctions were strictly cash sales, so the family got the money quickly. There were none of the otherwise crippling problems of collecting money owed in an industry that functioned very largely through credit and debt, a problem that bedevilled many apparently well-established publishers.4 Books were a necessary part of professional lives; they could also be seen as prudent pension planning.

> The most substantial legacy of Rome, none of whose libraries survived the fall of the western empire, was the gradual transition from papyrus scrolls to parchment books as the medium of storage. Parchment, made from animal skins, was a much more resilient surface, and it was on parchment that the learning of Rome lived out the next millennium in the monasteries of the Christian West. This thousand-year supremacy of the manuscript book provides us with some of the most hauntingly beautiful products of medieval culture: today, these manuscripts are the most treasured possessions of the libraries where they have found their final homes.
