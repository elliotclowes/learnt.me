> Foreign trade was flourishing when James I came to the throne. England, still an agricultural country, chiefly exported heavy woollen textiles, traded to northern, central and eastern Europe. After 1615 demand for these goods slumped. The immediate cause was the scheme devised by William Cockayne, a merchant and alderman, who thought more money could be made if all English cloth was dyed and dressed before export. He persuaded James to grant him a monopoly, but the project failed and helped to depress the cloth trade for decades. This catastrophe was partly offset by the English production of 'new draperies', lighter woollen-mix cloth mainly exported to southern Europe. This expanding trade helped to pay for imports from Spain and Portugal: wine, olive oil and fruit – chiefly raisins, consumed by all classes and without which, it was said, the English could 'hardly digest bread, pastries, broths and bag-puddings'. Since England exported woollens almost exclusively, markets for them were a source of constant anxiety. The growing Spanish market for England's lighter woollen textiles, which did not peak until 1620, was one reason why relations with Spain slowly grew more cordial. (Page 50)

> In the first half of the century long-distance trade fired merchants with genuine excitement, but its logistics were in development. In 1615 an estimated two-thirds of English seamen were still employed in the coal trade and the fisheries. The latter hardly impacted on London: West Country ports serviced the Newfoundland fishery and Yarmouth exported red herring to Spain and the Mediterranean. 10 Still, London's East India trade – which had moved forward as an extension of trade in the Levant – was becoming hugely profitable, despite Portuguese opposition in the Indian Ocean and the disapproval of the Dutch.

> James I gave the country two decades of peace, during which foreign trade prospered." The East India Company's most profitable 1612 voyage gave investors of their money back and a staggering 220 per cent profit.2 Within twenty years Its foundation the Company had more than ten trading bases in Asia and, until the troubled 1630s under Charles I, its gains exceeded all expectations.

> England's negative trade balance with France would be reversed in the first part of the eighteenth century, and the Huguenots had a large part in this. By 1700 about 5 per cent of London's population, then around 500,000, was French. All foreigners in London, not just the Huguenots, broadened people's horizons and made the capital more dynamic. Immigration was a positive factor in creating a city that was set to play a larger role on the world stage. None of this was evident at the time. What Londoners did notice was society's growing consumption and the change to lifestyles brought about by overseas trade. John Evelyn, preparing his daughter's satire for the press, lamented the introduction of foreign manners' and the general increase in luxury. Time was, he wrote, when 'the sturdy Oaken Bedstead, and Furniture of the House, lasted a whole Century, when Things of Use were Natural, Plain, and Wholesome'. But London society and language itself, had quite changed. (Page 263)

> Men, dressed as cardinals, carried aloft an effigy of the Pope, stuffed with live cats, who shrieked horribly at the event's climax when the effigy was burned on a giant bonfire at Temple Bar. (Page 275)

> The ever-present Thomas Neale was Master of the Mint, but he had many other calls on his time and his health was failing, so the bulk of the work fell to Newton, his deputy. Newton approached the task with the same intensity and attention to procedural detail that he had brought to his scientific and mathematical discoveries. Within a short space of time he had increased the production of coins to a record £100,000 a week and, as he was paid in proportion to the volume of coins struck, he was becoming very rich indeed. He moved out of temporary accommodation in the Tower to a house in Jermyn Street, Westminster. His duties as Warden included pursuing notorious counterfeiters and, after some reluctance, he threw himself into this activity as well, forging links with London's criminal underworld, infiltrating networks of semi-professional informers, taking evidence in taverns and prison cells, and successfully prosecuting twenty-eight offenders.

> By 1600 the population of London had risen to perhaps 200,000. In the tumultuous century that followed, it more than doubled, largely due to migration from the rest of England and an influx of refugees from France and the Netherlands fleeing religious persecution. Rapid growth transformed the metropolis and created problems of government. As London's suburbs expanded, largely housing the needy, the livery companies' ability to regulate trade and manufacture in those districts weakened. Houses were subdivided into tenements; poor sanitation grew worse, and disease was rife. By the 1690s, London was the largest city in Europe, with more than half a million inhabitants, and already fast evolving into a multicultural city. Aside from Huguenot and Flemish refugees, a Jewish community grew up in Bishopsgate, and international trade brought transient communities of seafarers and merchanrs from across the world. Growing numbers of African and Asian seamen swelled London's black population which, at the beginning of the century, had totalled just a few thousand black servants, musicians and dancers.

> In March 1605 the conspirators set to work again. Percy rented a cellar under the medieval House of Lords, and they began bringing the gunpowder across the Thames from Lambeth, concealing the barrels under piles of firewood. Fawkes, posing as Percy's servant and taking the name John Johnson, kept watch over the cellar. When the time came, he was to light a fuse, then escape to the Continent while the others raised rebellion in the Midlands. But as plague still raged in London, the opening of parliament was again postponed until 5 November. These delays made it difficult to keep the plot a secret, although conspirators had sworn an oath to do so. Newer recruits began to worry that Catholic Members of Parliament would be unfairly killed in the explosion. Seemingly it was one newcomer, Francis Tresham, who warned his brother-in-law, Lord Monteagle, not to attend the opening ceremony.

> In January 1604, James invited representatives of the Church of England and four moderate Puritans to Hampton Court Palace, outside London, where they conferred in bitterly cold weather over three days. James enjoyed showing off his learning and reported that he had soundly peppered' the Puritans and to debate them.

> A revised prayer book was published in February, differing little from the old one but officially sanctioned by the Church. The conference also resulted in a new, authorized translation of the Bible, the King James Version, which today is regarded as one of the greatest achievements in the English of the time, but which caused little stir when it appeared in 1611.

> The official number of plague deaths in 1665 was 68,596; probably it was closer to 90,000, almost a quarter of all Londoners.
