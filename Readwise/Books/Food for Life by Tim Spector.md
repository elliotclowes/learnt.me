> Although this technology has reduced in cost twentyfold in the last ten years, it still costs several hundred pounds if performed to a good standard using full shotgun sequencing methods. Luckily my team at KCL and ZOE have come up with a cheap and fun solution that everyone can try to provide a snapshot of their gut health. I should warn you that it involves turning your poo blue. As the PREDICT study participants ate muffins coloured with bright blue food dye to make recognition easy and we measured the transit time of food (from eating to toilet bowl): the shorter the transit time the healthier the gut microbiome, and the longer, the worse. The 'blue challenge', as it became known, was more successful than we could have imagined, beating the traditional stool test that is still being used by doctors to predict overall gut health.2 The average time was 29 hours, with some people seeing their blue poo as long as four to five days after eating the muffin. Generally, around 24 hours was healthy (mine are around 18-19 hours) and provide a snapshot as to the state of your gut microbes and ratio of good to bad guys. Shorter transit times were also linked to less type 2 diabetes, better blood sugar control and less internal fat, but too short (less than eight to ten hours) indicates you may have an infection or other health problems. This test was better than just counting the number of times per have a bowel movement or the consistency of the stool. Although the test is just correlation and not causation, it clearly shows that a healthy gut is related to having a swifter transit time and not being constipated. You can get the simple blue food dye recipes to test and educate your family and compare notes and results on the website.³ (Page 3)

> It wasn't thought that Western guts were home to many parasites, but as our detection methods have improved, we are finding more of them. I recently discovered I was one of 25 per cent of adults in the UK and only 4 per cent in the US to have a parasite called 'blastocystis' living permanently inside me. Amazingly, this bug actually keeps me (and other people) thinner and somehow makes me produce less internal fat. I'd love to know which foods to eat to keep this guy happy as they are found in virtually all non-developed populations and probably in all our ancestors. (Page 4)

> Many shiny apples we eat are actually months old, picked unripe and stored for months in dark warehouses then sprayed with ethylene to chemically ripen them. Most supermarket apples are cleaned and polished to remove the natural protection, and then sprayed with a wax coating to make them look shiny and still ripe. (Page 11)

> Smell is the only sense that has a direct link to the brain - like a superfast broadband connection. This allows us to rapidly construct flavour images from hundreds of chemicals. If you observe how dogs eat, there is little savouring of the subtle flavours. Dogs get most of their pleasure from the anticipation and initial odours rather than from the full mouth gastronomic experience. We credit cats with all kinds of extra powers and sixth senses, but they can't even detect sweet tastes or aromas. Rats have great orthonasal skills and can even detect if food is lacking in some nutrients, such as essential amino acids. (Page 17)

***

> Losing your sense of smell can be due to early dementia, however, as the brain centres that record food memories become damaged or cut off from the other parts of the brain. Even if the loss of smell is more subtle, it can be a harbinger of death. A 2014 study looked at 3,000 Americans aged fifty-seven to eighty-five and tested them with five classic smells - rose, leather, fish, orange and peppermint - and followed them for five years. Those with problems smelling had a fourfold risk of death. So, for whatever reason, smell and taste are pretty crucial to us humans. We don't yet know the answer, but we are studying whether loss of smell through Covid-19 has any longterm consequences. (Page 17)

> Most ultraprocessed foods (UPFs) contain mixtures of fat, salt and sugar in quantities that have been tested on human volunteers to produce the perfect bliss point which lights up the pleasure centres. The brain, once tricked, then produces feel-good neurochemicals like dopamine which override any signals of fullness from our gut mones or even our microbes.³ hor4 These three key flavours - fat, sugar and salt - with the addition of a "crunchy' mouthfeel, are used to convert cheap, tasteless and nutritionally useless base ingredients into addictive foods. Recent additions of flavour enhancers, artificial sweeteners, sugar alcohols and other new wonder chemicals are designed to increase this brain response and further disrupt our normal feedback loops of satiety. No foods in nature possess this heady, addictive mix, so we lack any evolutionary defence mechanism to stop us gorging on them. As a result, we are becoming fatter but less nourished, which is especially a problem for our children who are now growing up eating UPFs. (Page 18)

> The latest evidence shows that our microbes actually help inform us about what foods we should be eating, even causing us to crave certain foods. Our microbes literally send chemical messages to our brain to encourage us to eat what they need for their survival. Having lots of unhealthy microbes in your gut, therefore, can lead to a vicious cycle whereby you crave foods that help these less friendly bacteria, which in turn drive you to become less healthy. A stark example of this is seen in the difference in microbiome species between vegetarians and meat-eaters. When looking at 'good' and 'bad' microbiome species, we look for those that help reduce inflammation and those that promote it. Inflammation is our body's normal immediate response to trauma, stress or foreign bodies, including food proteins, which starts the healing process. Acute inflammation is a bit like the intense heat of a pizza oven that can be turned on or off. Chronic (meaning long-term) low-grade inflammation is like a smouldering fire that never goes out and stresses the body and is associated with nearly every long-term disease we know of. The meat-eaters tend to have many more pro-inflammatory species living in their guts which are associated with a tendency to crave meat products, whereas those who eat lots of plants have more beneficial microbe strains with less inflammation and often report not feeling the desire to eat animal products. Worryingly, this trend is exaggerated with UPFs, which not only look, smell, taste and feel good to our palates, they also bamboozle our bacteria and make us want more of the same. (Page 19)

> The body has a wonderful 24/7 defence system against disease, ageing and cancer. Our body is constantly repairing itself and fixing small genetic mutations, killing off misbehaving cells or sending out repair signals to build more protein or tiny blood vessels. Studies show that over the age of sixty, most of our bodies contain a multitude of micro-tumours, which never get to become fully blown cancer thanks to our effective immune surveillance systems. But these multiple defences get harder to maintain as we age. The microbiome plays a key role in all of these, and a few nutrients and vitamins in tiny levels are also critical to the many essential chemical reactions we need to thrive. (Page 23)

> Vitamin C or ascorbic acid provides an interesting illustration of the good and bad sides of vitamin-rich foods. Chilli, cabbage, yellow sweet peppers, kale, broccoli, sprouts and parsley are lesser-known great sources, but we all know that citrus fruits are full of vitamin C. Like many fruits, the ancestors of oranges, grapefruit, lemons and limes were impossibly sour and hard to eat. The Romans used citrus zest or juice to add flavour to food and drink, or as medicines and antidotes to poisons. In the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries around half of enlisted sailors died of scurvy, directly or indirectly an estimated 2 million men. In 1749, two centuries before vitamin C was discovered, after performing probably the first ever controlled trial, James Lind, a British naval doctor, found that citrus fruits helped prevent scurvy. Twelve scurvy-afflicted sailors were 'volunteered' for the trial, divided into six treatment groups, and given extra rations of the following potential 'cures': dilute sulphuric acid to burn away the 'putrefaction of the guts' (which was widely believed to be the cause); six spoons of vinegar; a quart of cider; half a pint of seawater; spicy barley water; or oranges and lemons. Unsurprisingly, the seawater and acid were not a success, and only the seamen taking the fruit or cider improved. Lind wrote up his findings in 1753, and then promptly left the navy to earn money practice and his findings were buried for decades.
>
> Lind's citrus cure was finally officially approved in 1795, leading to British domination of citrus-growing trade routes. All British sailors were given rations of limes (hence 'limeys'). It turned out that limes were not the best source of vitamin C, but they were tough and highly transportable, and the nation's now healthier navy dominated the world for the next hundred years.
>
> Once ascorbic acid (vitamin C) was discovered in 1927, it was promoted as the cure for all our ills and added to as many processed foods as possible. The idea was that if it cured scurvy, extra amounts would have powerful effects on our immune systems, fighting infections, cancer and ageing. A flawed study by Ewan Cameron in 1976 suggested that mega-doses could help terminal cancer.³ Although no group could prove this effect, the food industry loved it. They started selling more orange and fruit juice, and then chemical supplements, which were encouraged for the whole population, sometimes in massive doses. The science has finally caught up and meta-analysis of over twenty-nine studies and 11,000 people shows that extra vitamin C does not help prevent cancer, obesity or immune conditions. It also doesn't help prevent any new colds or reduce cold symptoms by more than a few hours. A recent large population study using the ZOE app showed that vitamin C supplementation does not help prevent Covid-19 infection but it still enjoys soaring sales as a supplement diverse range promising salvation from infections of all kinds. 4,5 Anyone eating a of fruits and vegetables never has to worry about vitamin C or dubious supplements.

> Vitamin D is another vitamin with celebrity status, and it is added to a wide variety of foods. I was always a big fan, but after spending twenty-five years researching and promoting calcium and vitamin D for bones in my hospital clinics, and writing over thirty related research articles, I have realised the data doesn't add up. It is one of the most studied 'vitamins' and one of the most hyped, having been proposed as a treatment or prevention for over a hundred diseases, with no good evidence to back any of the claims. The final nail in the coffin for me was when I played a minor part in a massive genetic study of fractures in over half a million people. It found there was no effect whatsoever of vitamin D, or milk drinking (and therefore calcium) on the risk of fracture. This data supports summary studies (called meta-analyses) of multiple trials of both vitamin D and calcium supplements, which, when you factor in poorquality studies, show there is no effect on preventing fracture or falls.6 Overuse of vitamin D supplements has been linked in several trials to increased falls and fractures, and calcium supplementation in normal doses has been linked in trials and genetic studies to modestly increased risk of heart disease.' So unless you are really deficient or are caring for someone who spends most of their days indoors, you are much safer getting your vitamin D from fifteen minutes of sunlight per day. In winter, underrated natural sources of vitamin D are oily fish, egg yolks and sunbathed mushrooms (especially shiitake and button), as well as fortified foods. The levels of vitamin D are generally not affected by cooking (Page 25)

> After five years collecting over 11,000 samples from citizen scientists around the world, the American/British Gut Project team produced its first findings. What turned out to be more important for gut health than whether you were a paleo follower, a fruitarian, a vegetarian or even a vegan, was the number of different plant species you ate each week. ¹3 Thirty different plants per week appeared to be optimal. We adjusted for all kinds of possible biases, such as education level, age, social status, smoking, alcohol, constipation, number of children, pets, body weight, diseases, medications, but all the data pointed to the same powerful effect the diversity of plants you regularly eat.
>
> Why should this be important? We have been brought up to think that if we eat an apple a day it will keep the doctor away, that carrots help your vision, spinach makes you stronger, and broccoli may make you live longer. If you ate only these plants every day, you should be super healthy. Well, not according to our results, at least not for your picky gut microbes. They would prefer you eat apple, broccoli and carrot on one day, but at least twenty-seven other different plants on other days of the week. Of course, plants include seeds, nuts, herbs and spices, which we may eat regularly in small quantities, and might not normally consider when we think about eating plants. Under the old nutritional paradigm of calories, sugars, fats and protein as building blocks, coupled with the simplistic view that plants mainly provide vitamin C and roughage to bulk up the gut, this idea makes no sense at all. But each plant, and sometimes specific bits of plants, has a unique set of chemicals, structure and flavour, and of course a specific role in nourishing our bodies via our microbes. So, it is the diversity of different plants that counts. (Page 28)

> In an observational study of nearly 2,000 twins we found those that ate large amounts of foods containing polyphenols had a 20 per cent reduction in risk of obesity, even after adjusting for fibre intakes. 14 Fibre intakes were also a major predictor of weight gain or loss over ten years in the same group, showing that polyphenols and fibre improve our health independently. 15 (Page 29)

> Conventional nutritional descriptors are not currently capable of measuring all the detrimental effects/aspects of UPFs, thus manufacturers can misleadingly market them as 'healthy' to an unwitting market. However, specific chemicals in UPFs have been proven to be bad for us. Hydrogenated or trans fats, for example, first created in the 1970s to solidify liquid fats by switching a few chemical bonds, which prolong the cupboard life of margarine, biscuits, savoury snacks and fast food, keeping them soft for months without going mouldy or drying out. The problem is the body couldn't deal with this new form of fat that caused inflammation and millions of deaths from early heart disease. Many countries have banned trans fats completely since the 2000s, but the UK and USA still allow a small percentage of trans fats, probably due to food industry lobbying. Even small amounts of trans fats (1-2 per cent of daily food intake) massively increase inflammation, lipid levels, heart disease and sudden death threefold, not even counting the extra cancers. Some people were consuming 10 per cent of their daily food intakes as trans fats, but the early reports of adverse health effects in the 1980s were largely dismissed as scaremongering. In 2019, the UK suggested a voluntary limit of 2g of trans fats per 100g of fat and better labelling, but still refuses a ban despite expert consensus that there is no safe lower limit. (Page 37)

> Nitrates also worry many people. Concerns were first raised when US observational data implicated nitrate (estimated from food surveys) as the factor linking meat consumption with risk of earlier death or heart disease. For a long time, the role of nitrates was difficult to interpret; indeed, hypotheses about their health effects changed from one week to the next, likely because we were trying to pin cause and effect to individual components of food, without considering the whole food in all its complexity. Nitrates (NO3) are mostly found in whole plant foods like beetroot, leafy greens and fruits. They are first broken down into nitrite (NO2) by bacteria in the mouth, then other microbes in our gut convert them into nitrosamines. Understanding the role of these different metabolites of nitrate is the key to knowing which to worry about. Based on our current knowledge, nitrate-rich whole foods are good for us, whereas nitrites when added to foods or resulting from cessing generally are not. Crucially, nitrate-rich foods are high in beneficial chemicals such as polyphenols and fibre, providing an overall protective effect, and they are associated with better heart health thanks to the conversion of nitrate to nitric oxide in the 'wall lining' of our body's blood vessels. Here, nitric oxide maintains healthy blood vessels and prevents clots associated with strokes and heart attacks. Eating more nitrate-rich foods protects against many chronic diseases and is associated with a 26 per cent reduced risk of gastric cancer. ¹0 In animal tests, dietary nitrate improves glucose and insulin balance as much as the diabetes drug metformin and has even greater protective effects on the heart and liver. In short, nitrates are a natural part of whole plants which have fibres, polyphenols and probiotic species of their own. When we eat nitrates in plants, we are eating a lot more than just the nitrates and so the overall effect is a beneficial one.
>
> 1Nitrites, on the other hand, are mostly found in processed meat and bean products as a result of changing or heating their original nitrate compounds. In these highly processed products nitrates are associated with an increased risk of cancer and other diseases, probably because these foods are lacking in protective polyphenols. Lastly, during ultra-processing, high-temperature cooking and storage nitrites in meat combine with amines in the protein to form nitrosamines. When these nitrates are converted to nitrites (and nitrosamines) outside of our bodies due to food processing they are no longer beneficial for us.
>
> Nitrosamines in processed meats have partly taken over the role of the bad boys in cancer, leading to calls to reduce our intakes. One large observational population study from France suggested that while nitrites explained a third of the increase in breast cancer associated with processed meats, the greater risk may actually be due to increasing levels of nitrosamine in the gut. Another study of half a million Americans (the NIH-AARP study) estimated that about half of the increase in mortality they found with processed meat could be attributed to nitrites.¹¹ So once again, whole plant foods are protective with their nitrate content, while highly processed meat and dairy products are likely to increase risk with their nitrites and nitrosamine content. The problem is not the nitrate compounds, it is the level of processing of the foods we eat. (Page 37)

> Finally, one of the unhealthiest things we can do is consume sugar in sweetened fizzy drinks like Coke, Pepsi or Fanta. This is now strongly linked to risk of obesity, type 2 diabetes and heart disease. ¹2 Increasingly, as well as added salt and sugar, in response to the demand to reduce sugar content manufacturers are adding artificial sweeteners. These were hailed as miracle products when they were first introduced, but sadly this was wishful thinking. Most of them saccharine, sucralose, aspartame, acesulfame K (AceK) - were created in labs, often by mistake by scientists working on fossil fuels.
>
> Others are the semi-natural sugar-alcohols, like xylitol used in chewing gums, or are derived from selected genetic strains of plants like stevia. In observational studies, these artificial sweeteners were associated with the same risks of obesity and disease as drinking regusugar. Better evidence comes from large-scale clinical trials where lar artificially sweetened drinks have no clear benefit to weight loss, despite the reduction in calories. This suggests they must have negative metabolic effects that offset the lower energy intake. This appears to happen mainly by disrupting the gut microbes, making them lose species diversity and produce abnormal chemicals which upset our normal metabolism and predispose us to type 2 diabetes. Another problem is that these drinks are designed to keep your sweetness threshold high - so you retain a sweet tooth even if you switch from natural to artificial sweeteners.¹3 This is a major problem in children who will seek out other sources of sweetness. These artificial chemicals are not inert and although many food companies dress them up as healthy alternatives, they are far from it.
>
> The context of how the food or drink is consumed can also be important in deciding if it is 'unhealthy'. Having a glass of high-sugar orange juice with your meal, or a block of chocolate afterwards with your coffee, will likely do less harm than having it on its own as a mid-morning or late-night snack. This is because although the calorie intake is the same, the sugar spikes and dips will be much greater when the food or drink are taken as a stand-alone snack, resulting in greater hunger levels in the next twelve hours and consequently overeating.¹4 It is easy to see why, with food companies pushing a combination of cheap tasty UPFs and snacks, often with misleading healthy labels, we have all tended to put on weight and increase our risk of type 2 diabetes thanks to a rollercoaster of blood glucose and lipid levels and postprandial inflammation throughout the day.

> Our immune system is also constantly working to alert the body to attend to other vital repairs, but DNA in our cells is simultaneously constantly mutating every time it replicates and causing errors. When we are young, a healthy immune system and the DNA repair mechanism work efficiently, but as we age, they start to fail. The immune system becomes overwhelmed with trying to deal with too many damaged cells at once, so the speed and quality of the repairs gradually deteriorates over time. This failure of the immune system to detect defects in our cells and initiate repairs helps to explain why our bodies age and why we develop cancers with increasing years. The speed at which this degradation happens varies from person to person, but we know that it is more rapid in overweight and obese individuals. (Page 45)

> People who regularly ate a lot of vegetables had lower levels of white blood cells, which meant they had lower levels of chronic inflammation and less risk of disease and infections. We also identified a gut microbe called 'collinsella' that increased white cell levels and risk of inflammation, and was also associated with overeating ultra-processed food.¹5 Collinsella likes to feed off a diet of fried starchy potatoes and has been linked in mouse studies to overeating potato crisps and French fries.

> Surprisingly, in spite of their high dietary fibre and polyphenol content, consuming fruits has not yet shown a significant beneficial effect in preventing inflammation or heart disease in our studies. This doesn't mean that some fruits are not healthy and more research is needed to understand why, but it may be because some fruits contain lot of sugar or are consumed in large amounts as drinks. A highsugar diet has been shown to be pro-inflammatory. On the other hand, it may be due to the certain compounds common in vegetables but not in fruits. Another possible clue is the comparatively low dietary nitrate content of fruit (see page 37). Approximately 60-80 per cent of our nitrate exposure comes from vegetable consumption, and this has been linked to better heart health, increased nitric oxide production, reduced inflammation and better immune function. (Page 51)

> When we eat meat or dairy products, certain gut microbes break down 'choline', the essential nutrient found in high levels in these foods, into harmless trimethylamine and the more insidious sideproduct trimethylamine-N-oxide (TMAO). This nasty chemical induces over-stimulation of the immune system leading to inflammation and furring of the arteries as well as causing blood clots and other heart problems.¹8 Some of us have the microbes that assist in counteracting this chemical reaction and some of us lack them, potentially explaining why it has been difficult to pin down whether good-quality meat is healthy or not. But in short, it would seem that meat and dairy may be bad for some people and not others.

> The gut microbiome and our diets are closely linked, and both of these factors interact with our immune system in complex ways. Immune-‘boosting' foods, therefore, are usually simply gut-friendly foods. The many gut-friendly properties of foods are also likely to bring benefits for the immune system which, as we have learnt, is wide ranging in its effects, from reducing allergy and fighting infections, to helping the body's defences against ageing and cancer. So, looking after your diet helps your gut microbes to help your immune system do its job. It is actually quite simple. (Page 51)

> In March 2018 on a skiing trip to Georgia, I was a passenger in a small six-seater helicopter that crashed in the mountains on the Russian border. Miraculously we walked away from the burning wreck unharmed. A few months later I watched the harrowing footage of the helicopter accident that killed the owners of Leicester City Football Club. Never again, I thought, would I contemplate a helicopter ride. The risk must be enormous. However, the statistics showed that in five years up to 2012, there were 4.4 helicopter accidents per 100,000 hours of flying, or around 0.004 per cent per trip. In fact, travelling by car for eleven hours is as risky as flying in a helicopter for an hour. But we all downgrade the risks of getting in a car because we do it so often. (Page 54)

> Over-simplistic cohort studies show that extremes of carbohydrate consumption (very low or very high) both impact mortality, whereas a middle ground of 50-55 per cent consumption is generally protective." Yet many indigenous populations have adapted to exist on virtually no plants or carbohydrates without obvious illeffects, such as the Inuit, Sami and the Tsimane in Bolivia, suggesting that in some environments, carbs, unlike fats or protein, are not essential. What we don't know for sure is whether adding plants to traditional Inuit diets would have made them any healthier (though those that move to urban areas are becoming unhealthy and dying early because of processed foods and poor health care). ¹0 Rather than arguing over the percentage in our diets, we should be looking at the type and quality of the carbohydrate. You only have to look at the beneficial impact of the Mediterranean diet and long-term veganism, where good-quality, whole-food, high-carbohydrate intake go hand in hand with longevity.
