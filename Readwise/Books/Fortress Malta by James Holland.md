> Back in 1800, Nelson had been fully aware of the important role Malta would play in maintaining domination of the Mediterranean, and had declared, 'I hope we shall never give it up", it was a sentiment Cunningham echoed some 140 years later. To his mind, British domination of the Mediterranean was crucial. At its western mouth, there was the British port of Gibraltar, the gateway to the Atlantic; while at the eastern end was the Suez Canal, the narrow passage that led to India and the Far East, and the port of Alexandria. Malta, a tiny island just seventeen miles by nine and slightly smaller than the Isle of Wight, lay almost exactly in the middle, and between Italy and North Africa. Tactically, this gave Britain a unique footing from which to attack enemy shipping in the Central Mediterranean, and in turn protect interests in the Middle East and Egypt. But it wasn't just its geographical situation that made it so crucial.

> Malta was also blessed with a fine natural harbour. Valletta, the Island's capital, stretched out like a long finger in the middle of this port, in places three hundred feet high above the surrounding waters. On its southern side was Grand Harbour, eighty feet deep and nearly two miles long with four inlets with dockyards around the middle two - French Creek and Dockyard Creek.

> Crucially, by the late 1930s, Grand Harbour had facilities and the trained expertise to equip and repair any ship in the British fleets. On the other side of the Valletta finger, to the north, lay Marsamxett Harbour, seventy feet deep and divided from Sliema Creek by Manoel Island. Both harbours could house the biggest ships in the world and shield them from the fiercest storms. Overlooking them were the mighty bastions of Valletta and the Three Cities, enormous fortified walls built of creamy limestone blocks by the Knights of St John in the sixteenth century, from where defensive gun batteries could rain down their fire on any would-be attackers. Their potential as gun emplacements had not diminished during the ensuing centuries (Page 22)

> The French had taken over the Island in 1798, but following their defeat at the Battle of the Nile, their position in the Mediterranean was considerably weakened and, after an occupation of plunder and misrule, the Maltese took the opportunity to revolt. Besieged within the city walls of Valletta by the Maltese, and by the British out at sea, the French soon capitulated. Although the Island was still not formally under British jurisdiction, the Union Jack was run up over Valletta on 5 September 1800. In a Declaration of Rights, however, the Maltese people demanded to come under the protection and sovereignty of the King of the free people, His Majesty the King of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland.' They also demanded that 'His Majesty has no right to cede these Islands if he chooses to withdraw his protection, and to any power abandon his sovereignty, the right of electing another sovereign, or of the governing of these islands, belongs to us, the inhabitants and aborigines alone, and without control." Under these unique circumstances, the close relationship between the British and Maltese began. It was, of course, a mutually beneficial arrangement: the Maltese now had a protector one that just happened to have the most powerful navy in the world and the British an island of immense strategic importance.

> For those who simply wanted to let their hair down, there were any number of restaurants, bars and nightclubs. Food and drink were cheap and plentiful. As cabaret dancer Christina Ratcliffe noted, Malta before the war was a 'boozer's paradise'. Spirits were sixpence a tot and beer fourpence a bottle. Most servicemen made for Strait Street, as its name suggests, a long, narrow street in Valletta known to everyone as 'The Gut'. During the day it was dead, drab and dusty, working off the hangover of the previous evening, but by night it sprang into life, ablaze with colour and noise and teeming with soldiers and sailors surfeiting on cheap booze, girls and jazz. As the night progressed, so the din became louder - drunken servicemen singing raucously, shouting and brawling.

> Whether permanently stationed on the Island or just passing through, servicemen found Malta had much to offer. And in turn, the British, with their Army and Navy, offered security and trade to the native Maltese. (Page 25)
