## Highlights
***

> The beauty of a naked body is only appreciated by cultures that use clothing. Modesty is important for sensuality like resistance for energy.
>
> Artificiality is the best way to enjoy what's natural. Whatever I've enjoyed in these vast fields I've enjoyed because I don't live here.
>
> One who has never lived under constraints doesn't know what freedom is.
>
> Civilization is an education in nature. Artificiality is the path for appreciating what's natural. We should never, however, take the artificial for the natural.
>
> It's the harmony between the natural and the artificial that constitutes the natural state of the superior human soul. (Page 50)

> The environment is the soul of things. Each thing has its own expression and this expression comes from outside it. Each thing is the intersection of three lines, and these three lines form the thing: a certain quantity of material, the way in which we interpret it, and the environment it's in. This table on which I'm writing is a block of wood, it's the table, and it's a piece of furniture among others in the room. My impression of this table, if I wish to transcribe it, will be composed of the notions that it is made of wood, that I call it a table and attribute certain uses to it, and that it receives, reflects and is transformed by the objects placed on top of it, in whose juxtaposition it has an external soul. And its very colour, the fading of that colour, its spots and cracks - all came from outside it, and this (more than its wooden essence) is what gives it its soul. And the core of that soul, its being a table, also came from the outside, which is its personality.
>
> I consider it neither a human nor a literary error to attribute a soul to the things we call inanimate. To be a thing is to be the object of an attribution. It may be erroneous to say that a tree feels, that a river runs, that a sunset is sad or that the calm ocean (blue from the sky it doesn't have) smiles (from the sun outside it). But it's every bit as erroneous to attribute beauty to things. It's every bit as erroneous to say that things possess colour, form, perhaps even being. This ocean is saltwater. This sunset is the initial diminishing of sunlight in this particular latitude and longitude. This little boy playing next to me is an intellectual mass of cells - better yet, he's a clockwork of subatomic movements, a strange electrical conglomeration of millions of solar systems in miniature.
>
> Everything comes from outside, and the human soul itself may be no more than the ray of sunlight that shines and isolates from the soil the pile of dung that's the body.
>
> In these considerations there may be an entire philosophy for someone with the strength to draw conclusions. It won't be me.
>
> Lucid vague thoughts and logical possibilities occur to me, but they all dim in the vision of a ray of sunlight that gilds a pile of dung like wetly squished dark straw, on the almost black soil next to a stone wall.
>
> That's how I am. When I want to think, I look. When I want to descend into my soul, I suddenly freeze, oblivious, at the top of the long spiral staircase, looking through the upper-storey window at the sun that bathes the sprawling mass of rooftops in a tawny farewell. (Page 58)

> Whenever my ambition, influenced by my dreams, rose above the everyday level of my life, so that for a moment I seemed to soar, like a child on a swing, I always - like the child - had to come down to the public garden and face my defeat, with no flags to wave in battle and no sword I was strong enough to unsheathe.
>
> I suppose that most of the people I chance to pass in the street also feel - I notice it in their silently moving lips and in their eyes' vague uncertainty, or in the sometimes raised voice of their joint mumbling - like a flagless army fighting a hopeless war. And probably all of them - I turn around to see their slumping, defeatedlooking shoulders - share with me this sense of menial squalor, of definitive defeat amid reeds and scum, with no moonlight over the shores or poetry in the marshes. 
>
> […] Let the gods change my dreams, but not my gift for dreaming 
>
> […]Poor menial demigods who conquer empires with lofty words and intentions but need to scrounge up money for food and the rent!
>
> […] I'm with these poor slobs who have no books to show, who have no literature besides their own soul (for they've stopped reading the other kind), and who are suffocating to death due to the fact they exist without having taken that mysterious, transcendental exam that makes one eligible to live. (Page 59)

> I'm the ruins of buildings that were never more than ruins, whose builder, halfway through, got tired of thinking about what he was building. (Page 62)

> And it's always the same succession of the same old phrases And then she said .', and the tone foreshadows the intrigue to follow. 'If it wasn't him, it was you and the voice that answers bristles in a protest already out of my hearing range. You said it, yes sir, I heard you..., and the seamstress's shrill voice declares 'My mother says she's not interested...' 'Me?', and the astonishment of the fellow carrying a lunch wrapped in white paper doesn't convince me, and probably not the dirty blonde either. 'It must have been and the giggling of three of the four girls drowns out the obscenity. And then I walked straight up to the guy, and right in his face, but I mean right in his face, José, just imagine and the poor devil is lying, because the office supervisor I can tell by the voice that the other contender was the supervisor of the office in question wouldn't receive the straw gladiator's challenge in the arena surrounded by desks. And then I went and smoked in the bathroom .. laughs the little boy with dark patches on his trouserseat.

> […] ‘The guy was so soused he couldn't even see the stairs." I raise my head. At least this young man describes. These people are more bearable when they describe, since in describing they forget themselves. My nausea subsides. I see the guy. I see him photographically. Even the innocuous slang heartens me. Blessed breeze across my forehead - the guy so soused he couldn't see the steps of the staircase - perhaps the staircase where humanity stumbles, gropes and shoves its way up the corrugated illusion which only a wall separates from the sharp drop behind the building.
>
> Intrigue, gossip, the braggart's tall tale about what he didn't have the guts to do, the contentment of each miserable creature dressed in the unconscious consciousness of his own soul, sweaty and smelly sexuality, the jokes they tell like monkeys tickling each other, their appalling ignorance of their utter unimportance... All of this leaves me with the impression of a monstrous and vile animal created in the chaos of dreams, out of desires' soggy crusts, out of sensations' chewed-up leftovers ... (Page 63)

***

> Yes, I reread these pages that represent worthless hours, brief illusions or moments of calm, large hopes channelled into the landscape, sorrows like closed rooms, certain voices, a huge weariness, the unwritten gospel.
>
> We all have our vanity, and that vanity is our way of forgetting there are other people with a soul like our own. My vanity consists of a few pages, passages, doubts...
>
> I reread? A lie! I don't dare reread. I can't reread. What good would it do me? The person in the writing is someone else. I no longer understand a thing. (Page 65)

***

> I weep over my imperfect pages, but if future generations read them, they will be more touched by my weeping than by any perfection I might have achieved, since perfection would have kept me from weeping and, therefore, from writing. Perfection never materializes. The saint weeps, and is human. God is silent. That is why we can love the saint but cannot love God (Page 65)

> We generally colour our ideas of the unknown with our notions of the known. If we call death a sleep, it's because it seems like sleep on the outside; if we call death a new life, it's because it seems like something different from life. With slight misconceptions of reality we fabricate our hopes and beliefs, and we live off crusts that we call cakes, like poor children who make believe they're happy.
>
> But that's how all life is, or at least that particular system of life generally known as civilization. Civilization consists in giving something a name that doesn't belong to it and then dreaming over the result. And the false name joined to the true dream does create a new reality. The object does change into something else, because we make it change. We manufacture realities. The raw material remains the same, but our art gives it a form that makes it into something not the same. A pinewood table is still pinewood, but it's also a table. We sit at the table, not at the pinewood. Although love is a sexual instinct, it's not with sexual instinct that we love but with the conjecture of some other feeling. And that conjecture is already some other feeling (Page 66)

> The afternoon comes to a monotonous and rainless close, in an uncertain and despondent tone of light. And I stop writing because I stop writing. (Page 67)

***

> I have no use for motor vehicles. I have no use for the products of science - telephones, telegraphs - which make life easy, nor for its fanciful by-products - phonographs, radios - which make life amusing for those who are amused by such things.
>
> None of that interests me, none of it appeals. But I love the Tagus because of the big city along its shore. I delight in the sky because I see it from the fourth floor on a downtown street. Nothing the country can give me compares with the jagged majesty of the tranquil, moonlit city as seen from Graça or São Pedro de Alcân tara.* There are no flowers for me like the variegated colouring Lisbon on a sunny day.
