## Highlights
***

> John Boorman has gone on record saying how grateful he is that he didn't get to make his film. That may have prevented the project from ever passing to Jackson, whose trilogy he thought was a marvel akin to the construction of the great cathedrals of medieval Europe. There was something secret and vast about the films, a work of almost divine providence. (Page 11)

> They were constantly trying to insert the structural lessons gleaned from McKee to the glacial magnificence of Tolkien: climaxes, twists, foreshadowings, turning points and delayed reveals. Balanced with wilfully obscure references to his deep mythology. His archaic language could have enormous power when delivered by an Ian McKellen or Christopher Lee. But for clarity they would trim and edit from the book, moving passages around in the chronology or between speakers like a slider puzzle.
> Boyens' ancient prologue was still being reworked in post.
> 'I first wrote it as Gandalf narrating,' she says, running back through the manifold revisions in her head there had been a Frodo-narrated version at one stage. 'And then I wrote it in the voice of Galadriel. That was Fran's idea, and it was a good one. Then when we were recording the ADR in London, I said to Fran, "Can we overlay it in Elvish?" You want that sense of strangeness of history.'
> The trilogy's overture carries the quality of a dream as Blanchett's yearning voice pulls us across the frontier into Tolkien's imagination. (Page 104)

> Jackson thought of going back to Crowe and between them Boyens and Walsh brought up Mortensen. They immediately plunged into his back catalogue Daylight, The Portrait of a Lady, G.I. Jane, A Perfect Murder-assured by the intensity of his blue eyes, chiselled cheekbones and the way he commanded your attention with minimal effort.
> 'Fran's a great believer in fate,' says Boyens. 'The person who needs to play this role will come to us.'
> He wasn't in any way British, but both Boyens and Jackson liked that his Scandinavian heritage chimed with the Nordic sagas from which Tolkien had drawn.
> Everything about Mortensen seemed to add up. He was an actor for whom the idea of celebrity carried little value. He lived - and would place even further distance apart from Hollywood between them once the films had bequeathed him superstardom. He had romance written into the pages of his life. Born in New York raised in South America, schooled in the foothills of Argentina, returning to graduate from a New York high school, then off to find a purpose in the Denmark of his father's upbringing. There he took to writing poetry and short stories, odd jobbing as a dockworker and selling flowers. Back then to New York and acting classes, before moving to Los Angeles where a small part in Witness began a career in earnest. During which time he never stopped filling his mind and soul with music (he possesses a fine singing voice), photography, painting and publishing books of his own pictures and poetry.
> This is before you considered his outdoor side. How he loved to lose himself in the wilderness for days, ride horses, fish, sleep beneath the stars and generally unbuckle himself from civilization. On his mother's side he was related to Buffalo Bill. If he had a credo, then it was 'go see for yourself'. He spoke Danish, Spanish, French and English fluently, travelled the world, read the greats, including the Nordic and Icelandic sagas, and never wasted a word.
> To which one can only wonder why had they ever wanted anyone else to play Aragorn?
> 'He cared, you know?' says Boyens. 'And he was really smart.
> Yeah, he was gorgeous, but beyond that he's a poet. He's a Renaissance man. All that physicality he did standing on his head. That's who he was. But the other stuff was just a gift. That he had that soul. That he loved language. That he was meticulous, even though sometimes to the point where it drove you crazy. We'd see Viggo coming at you with the book in his hand, and you'd go, "Oh God." (Page 178)
