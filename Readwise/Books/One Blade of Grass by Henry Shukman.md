> In the Phaedrus, Plato thus compared the soul to a chariot pulled by two winged horses, one wild and unruly, the other noble and obedient. (Page 237)

> Along the way I heard about the old monk Père Charles de Foucauld, a former French army officer and Parisian bon vivant who was transformed by the desert into a seeker of solitude and silence. My journey turned into a half-baked pilgrimage as I took in the remote desert towns where a hundred years before Foucauld had built his hermitages. I tasted the silence in his old stone chambers and saw the bullet holes in the mortar from the shots that had killed him. He had befriended the "blue men" of the French Sahara, the Tuareg, and left behind a small contemplative order in the desert, the Little Brothers and Sisters of Jesus. It made unexpected sense: to forgo ordinary Western ways, to stake your life on the magnitude of the desert, on God's garden, as the Tuareg called it. The bare fact of life and death was somehow closer here.

> They said God kept the desert empty so there would be one place left on earth for him alone.
>
> To live here felt like a kind of existential solution.
>
> I picked up Carlo Carretto's Letters from the Desert. He had been a party-going city dweller until one day the emptiness of his life overwhelmed him and he gave up everything to come to the desert, where he joined Foucauld's order.
>
> I Sought and I Found, another of his books was called: his whole biography was there, in the title.
>
> Something about it kept calling to me, even after I traipsed back home to the mountainous thesis and my semi-functional half-life in the London rain.

> I had a diagnosis now: dysthymia. Persistent, low-grade, shame-based depression. It was tricky, because one of its symptoms was a denial of symptoms prompted by shame at the symptoms-the shame itself being one of the symptoms. Cleverly circular. But the new cognitive-behavioral approach was actually helping. I never knew what diabolical habits of mind I'd had. It turned out that as long as I could remember, I'd been thinking myself into misery.
>
> I beat myself up, put myself down, shoulded myself to death, catastrophized and awfulized. I was an inveterate musturbator: I must do this, that must work out, et cetera. As I exposed and gave up these habitual cognitions, to be alive became stranger and more interesting.
>
> One day as I was leaving the flat, I caught sight of my face in the mirror by the door, and it was as if I'd never seen myself before. Who was this person? It reminded me of Derek Walcott's poem where he meets himself in the mirror:
>
> You will greet yourself arriving
>
> at your own door, in your own mirror
>
> and each will smile at the other's welcome…
>
> You will love again the stranger who was your self.
