> As Mill described in a report to his father at age fourteen, on a typical day, he got up at 5 a.m., starting with a morning swim, then it was on to French lessons until breakfast, then music theory, and then back to French. This was followed by Greek, Latin, mathematics, logic, and political economy. Music lessons came later in the afternoon, then horseback riding until 6 p.m., fencing until 7 p.m., and dancing lessons until 8.30 p.m. The evening was his time to work on personal projects. On the day John happened to be sending this account to his father, it had consisted of working on an ode to the economies of scale featured in oligopolistic competition: 'a dialogue on benefit of large estates to commerce'.

> It bears asking, why should we concern ourselves with the efforts of the wealthy at gaining one another's esteem, either in Veblen's day or in our own? At a time when the problem of scarcity remains far from resolved for the humanity, and just as our sights are turned towards resolving urgent problems from inequality to social injustice, what do the strenuous contortions of the rich philanthropic class have to do with the rest of us?
>
> Examining those on top is valuable if it offers us a preview of what may lie ahead. It pushes us to ask J. S. Mill's question: assuming that our social objectives were attained - that the problem of scarcity, for instance, were in fact resolved – what then? Would we be content? Well, let's consider the wealthy.
>
> As John Maynard Keynes pointed out, they are 'our advance guard - those who are spying out the promised land for the rest of us'. What we wish for ourselves and for our children is to have similarly unlimited financial means, so that we may finally focus on the 'real business of life'." And yet, as Keynes observed in 1930, the early reports sent back by these scouts are not favourable; the rich, he concluded then, have 'failed disastrously'. Just as with Veblen's nineteenth-century leisure class, the value of consumption among elites invariably extinguishes itself; its social potency becomes debased. What self-worth they can derive through their material ease is progressively eroded by their inner 'impartial spectator' who, in detecting the intentions of others, comes to second-guess their own. The point is not to pity the rich. It is, rather, to understand that the social benefits that come from joining their ranks are eroded just as our ability to do so increases. Social functions that were previously achievable through efforts of will - saving, anticipating, purchasing, and rejoicing – increasingly elude us. The more ardent our will and the clearer our intention, the less likely we are to make the impression we want to make.
>
> The takeaway is that in those few pockets where affluence has been attained, not only has full contentment not followed, but the means of affluence have been getting in the way of that contentment. The wealthy thus represent a particularly good case study for how products turn into byproducts. Yet the Veblen Treadmill affects us all.
>
> You will be relieved to hear that the rich have not given in.
>
> The Veblen Treadmill keeps running, and the wealthy huff and puff to keep up. Under Adam Smith, they sewed additional pockets to hold more goods to show off to one another. Under Veblen, they embraced waste. Today, they are reversing course.
>
> Aspiring instead to an outward image of thriftiness, today's most discerning elites have turned to acquiring goods that have the credible pretence of utility. Effective means of doing this include investing in private healthcare, childcare, and higher education.
>
> In the United States, especially, higher education has becomein ways that conveniently serve its social signalling purposes exorbitantly expensive. Crucially, however, in paying $70,000 a year for the education of each of their children, a well-off family can plausibly claim that they are not doing so to impress anyone, but because they value the education of their children for its own sake.
>
> The success of this strategy of distinction rests on the ambiguity of the parents' intent. It is precisely because it can be seen to serve an inherent purpose ('in today's competitive economy, a good education is more important than ever') that a degree from a prestigious school achieves its social function. The same goes for spending on healthcare and its self-care offshoots.
>
> As the professor of public policy Elizabeth Currid-Halkett has noted, this shift towards non-ostentatious, functional goods has real social consequences." By not actively flaunting their advantage, it becomes easier for the wealthy to deny its existence, which may end up having more pernicious effects on inequality than the open displays of ease by Veblen's well-to-do.
>
> The nineteenth-century leisure class made for an easier target for popular economic grievances and the political leaders that emerged to represent them. By comparison, the well-off family living in a Brooklyn walk-up and spending their money on expensive dental care, tutors, and Ivy League educations is a less obvious object of scorn. But the functional nature of these goods may end up perpetuating class divides, in ways that expensive watches and yachts merely made more apparent. The ownership of a yacht did not pay its own dividend; it did not make the gap deeper. By contrast, fancy educations not only serve an effective social signalling function by camouflaging the underlying intent, but they may also be the most effective means of passing one's higher status on to the next generation.
>
> Similarly, private healthcare spending (especially if it displaces public sector investments) contributes to a widening gap in life expectancy between rich and poor.
>
> By this shift towards functional goods, the well-to-do thus achieve the goal of social distinction once more. Yet this too will invariably change. The Veblen Treadmill keeps running, and the effectiveness of any good at signalling status rarely endures. (Page 64)

> Yet Mill kept seeing the same paradox in different guises.
>
> Take the benefits of education, a topic Mill considered at some length, likely because of the peculiarity of his own upbringing.
>
> As he wrote in an 1846 article, 'What shapes the character is not what is purposely taught, so much as the unintentional teaching of institutions and social relations.' The formation of good character, in this way, resists deliberate inculcation. It only lets itself be affected by lessons which do not appear to be lessons. But it took another Utilitarian thinker to take up J. S. Mill's idea and render it fit for use, by giving it, for starters, a less unwieldy label. Henry Sidgwick makes up the third branch of the holy trinity of Utilitarianism, together with Bentham and Mill. His 1874 Methods of Ethics is usually thought of as the culmination of the Utilitarian school of thought, and it is widely considered one of the greatest books ever written on moral philosophy. It is there that we find the classic statement of what has come to be known as the paradox of hedonism. As Sidgwick writes: 'Here comes into view what we may call the fundamental paradox of Hedonism, that the impulse towards pleasure, if too predominant, defeats its own aim.' Ever since, having thus obtained its imprimatur among philosophers from Sidgwick, the paradox of hedonism has been taken up and remarked on with increasing frequency.
>
> Here is a more recent formulation from the philosopher Peter Railton:
>
> > The hedonist, looking around him, may discover that some of those who are less concerned with their own happiness than he is, and who view people and projects less instrumentally than he does, actually manage to live happier lives than he despite his dogged pursuit of happiness the hedonist, it would appear, ought not to be a hedonist.33 (Page 80)

> If the cult of authenticity were limited to twisting the incentives of pop celebrity, there would be little to worry about.
>
> But the 'aesthetic of the real' manifests itself in more worrying ways. In the wake of the Great Recession of 2008, democracies across the world fell prone to a wave of political populism.
>
> The United States, Brazil, India, the UK, Poland, Hungary, and the Philippines are among the countries that turned to a similar strain of right-wing political entrepreneur.
>
> Populist leaders succeed by leveraging the cult of authenticity in political life. Political scientists usually define populisma concept with many competing meanings as the pitting 120 of a genuine, 'authentic people' (the populist's audience) against an inauthentic people (made up, as the case may be, of coastal elites, immigrants, or sexual and ethnic minorities). The core claim of populism is that 'only some of the people are really the people' 36 And the populist leader stands for the real people among the people, in opposition to the 'other'. We thus get repeated invocations of the 'real Americans' living in the heartland. Consider Nigel Farage, the former leader of the UK Independence Party, declaring Brexit 'a victory for real people.
>
> The populist rides to victory on the attempt by political audiences to detect intent. The populist's currency is credibility.
>
> This may seem an extraordinary claim to make, given how often populist leaders, drawing on the recent American exemplar, deal in lies and misrepresentation. But what unites them is a willingness to say the unsayable. Followers marvel at how only the populist leader 'says it like it is'. And this willingness, by itself, becomes of greater importance than the content of the 'it' which is being said. The label of authenticity thus attaches itself more readily to appearance, tone, demeanour, and swagger, than to the content of the political message itself. Social media serves as a great enabler of both the famous-for-being-famous and the populist politician. Both rely on a perception of unmediated reality, something that the unbridled aspect of late-night tweets can offer - spelling mistakes and exclamation marks included.
>
> And just as putting down a costly stake is a means of attaining credibility in economic settings, the willingness to incur mainstream censure for making outrageous claims is a testament to the populist's authenticity. It is the way by which populists disassociate themselves from the realm of calculating, run-ofthe-mill politics. Naked lies thus register as more genuine than the centrist politician who must hedge her message to meet the demands of the truth, not to mention the constraints of courtesy or respectability. A devotion to the truth becomes a compromising position. The ultimate irony, then, is that the perception of authenticity may pass through untruth: the willingness to break existing codes by telling lies is interpreted as a form of loyalty.
>
> When the label becomes more important than the content it is affixed to, lying can become an investment in believability.
>
> The elevation of an aesthetic of authenticity in politics hits mainstream career politicians particularly hard. In debates, they must roll out carefully planned messaging under the guise of spontaneity. While they may fool some by feigned ad libs others will dismiss these efforts as "overly focus-grouped'. In and failing to grasp the paradox of intention, their political consultants have been known to react by rolling out a 'spontaneity strategy', oblivious to how such efforts inevitably backfire, fuelling the audience's misgivings.37 accounts for proThe value attributed to authenticity partly another puzzling aspect of electoral politics in democratic societies, which is that it is the rare field that does not reward fessionalisation. In most domains, people pick an area, acquire experience in it, build on that experience over their career, and profit from it. They become specialists, experts. It is often a condition for plying their trade. We want to know how many surgeries our surgeon has performed before we submit ourselves to the scalpel; we don't value their coming fresh to the task, untarnished by past experience. This is also why a mechanic cannot decide to become a cook overnight, or an engineer suddenly turn into a nurse. But politics seems impervious to expertise; it rewards self-professed dabblers, and sometimes real ones.
>
> Owing to a prevalent incumbent advantage, most high-level politicians are in fact career policymakers, but they rarely admit to it. Why is this?
>
> Politics is an exercise in persuasion. It's the art of making your selfish desires seem like the national interest'.38 But who is willing to be persuaded by a suave expert at persuasion?
>
> We fear being had by a well-honed pitch. Instead, we prefer to be persuaded by bumbling amateurs who happen to have a good case.
>
> More recently, the sociologist David Riesman observed how this focus on sincerity, both in popular culture and in politics, leads the audience tolerantly to overlook the incompetence performance Forced to choose between skill and sincerity, many in the audience prefer the latter. They are tolerant of bumbles and obvious ineptness if the leader tries hard.'39 When it comes to changing people's minds, the appearance of incompetence can be reassuring.
>
> Populists count on this effect. As in the case of celebrities famous for being famous, with no product to hustle other than their unmediated selves, the populist politician often boasts of a lack of actual political expertise. Incompetence appears comforting if it represents an absence of calculation, because calculation has come to be seen as posing the greatest risk. The cult of authenticity, and the attendant hunt for signs of inauthenticity, translates into a set of aesthetic codes, and these can have frightful effects. (Page 120)

> Though they have opposite origins and opposite destinations, we have seen how the sellout and the faker often meet in the middle, suspended between the two realms. The sellout keeps gesturing towards her native land of disinterest, while the faker is unable to fully shake the mannerisms that betray his selfinterested origins. The sellout wants to persuade us that she has not crossed over entirely; the faker assures us that he has, though he is ultimately unable to.
>
> Our two characters share something else in common. We have seen that the faker's destiny is a tragic one: in setting out to appear disinterested, the faker's initial intention would seem to preclude the possibility of success. But the sellout's trajectory is no less marked by tragedy. Like Oedipus running away from his foretold destiny, the sellout shuns the market, only to grow irresistible to it. Eventually, the temptation to cede to the very ideals she initially shunned becomes too much to bear. It is the sellout's initial disinterestedness that marks her ultimate downfall - by the very standard of her original ideals.
>
> As with the Puritans and the utopian communes of the 1800s, so too with the hippies of the 1960s. By trying to espouse values squarely opposed to the Spirit of Capitalism, they proved overwhelmingly captivating to market society. Disinterest is a draw.
>
> And this appeal to the sphere of interested commerce is what creates the incentive to sell out, which in turn kills off the source of the initial market appeal. In elevating passion, the market precipitates its eventual devaluation. Music bands cannot help but care about their growing audience, just as Puritans cannot help but shift their view of prosperity, from a byproduct to the goal itself. And passionate entrepreneurs 'not in it for the money' eventually find that, as their passion begins to pay off, money may not be such a bad thing to be in it for. (Page 170)

> Tellingly, with the exception of the Romantics, attempts at charting the multiple self have most often been put in the service of elucidating problems of weakness of will. These are cases where we may intend to act purposefully and rationally, but we find ourselves unable to carry through on our resolve. That is, an intentional part of us is derailed by some more impulsive part of us. This is the predicament of Ulysses unable to resist the song of the sirens once he hears it; or that of my students who vow to finish an assignment over the weekend, but never quite get to it. The Greeks called this akrasia, or a lack of command.
>
> Today, people are more likely to refer to procrastination (literally, 'pushing forward to tomorrow'), or the instant gratification monkey. Akrasia underlies a whole host of modern complaints, from the inability to carry through on our projects to our failures to keep New Year's resolutions.
>
> The problem we have been concerned with over the prior seven chapters is the exact opposite of akrasia: not weakness of will, but an excess of will. Across the different guises we have seen it in, the paradox of intention comes from holding on too strongly to a predefined intention. And while far more popular attention gets paid to problems of akrasia, we have seen why our modern malaise might result more often from that opposite, an excess of will - and that this becomes truer as a society grows more affluent. People increasingly will things that evade wilful effort.
>
> Our very fixation on fighting akratic behaviour - behold the hundreds of apps and thousands of self-help tomes on beating procrastination once and for all - speaks to our biases. It's a testament to how much we privilege instrumental, goal-oriented behaviour. Steeling our resolve and strengthening our will seem like the remedy to every problem. Any failure is ascribed to not having wanted it enough. By contrast, as J. S. Mill and others have argued, our most meaningful failures may be due to our anticipation of the desired outcomes. If we could only lose sight of our objectives, we might be better able to reach them. (Page 238)

> This brings to mind an old joke. A man walks into the city's most reputed jeweller with a huge raw diamond, to have it cut for an engagement ring. Given the value of the stone, the owner of the shop is called in. He considers the stone in awe, and finally calls out to his lowliest apprentice, as if ringing up an order for a pastrami sandwich: 'Avi, cut this stone for me.' And before the terrified customer's eyes, Avi goes to work on the stone, and soon wraps up his task. The stone is handed back, perfectly cut.
>
> Relieved but visibly rattled, the customer asks the owner, 'How could you give this priceless gem to a lowly apprentice to cut?'
>
> To which the owner replies, 'I know how much this stone is worth. If I tried to cut it myself, my hand would shake. Whereas Avi, he doesn't know any better, so his hand is steady.'
>
> The takeaway, of course, is that when our self-awareness gets in our way, as when we realise how high the stakes are, we stand to gain from calling on an internal Avi, who goes ahead and simply does the job without second-guessing himself. Accessing the Avi within is how one attains Castiglione's state of grace.

> Tackling the question of sleep, a paradigmatic byproduct state, Elster recalls a case where an insomniac is told by her Jon therapist to carefully record in writing all her physiological symptoms at night, to better help diagnose her condition. She does so, and taken up by the notetaking, swiftly falls asleep.
>
> Elster was drawing on Viktor Frankl, the psychiatrist who first labelled those states that elude wilful effort as 'byproduct states'.
>
> Frankl instructed his own patients suffering from insomnia to try instead to stay awake as long as possible. Taking up opposite aims in this way, Frankl claimed, was a remedy for a range of instances of excessive will, from insomnia and sexual impotence to writer's cramp. Sometimes, the same ruse could even be arrived at by accident. Frankl recalls the story of a man with a severe speech impediment who tries to intentionally stutter to elicit compassion from a policeman, and finds that his stutter has suddenly left him.
>
> According to Frankl, pursuing an opposite aim is a way to detach one from oneself', a way for people to become unstuck deliberately stay awake is designed to throw off that part within from their wanting, planning, instrumental self. Attempting to that is stubbornly trained on the objective of sleep. It is deliberately inefficient; once more, the roundabout way proves the shortest workable path Yet Elster, for one, remains characteristically pessimistic: the ploy can work once, he concedes, but as soon as it is seen for what it is, the patient becomes immune to it, and falls prone to insomnia once more. These folk remedies confirm how attempts to evade the paradox of intention are premised on some sleight of hand. In these cases, one person must know something the other does not. The trick for addressing insomnia only works if the patient remains unaware of its true intent. If the secretly intended result is anticipated, the familiar paradox rears its head anew, and all is lost - which hardly makes for a reliable remedy (Page 241)

> And getting at the same notion of collective self-deception, here's my favourite of all of La Rochefoucauld's maxims: "There are people who would never fall in love, had they not previously heard it mentioned."¹4 And yet, fall they do. This, La Rochefoucauld doesn't deny; those he derides really are in love, with all that 'falling in' entails.
>
> He is merely poking fun at love's origins, and the need for outside assistance. So be it: read soppy love stories if Doesn't everyone? In the personal notes of the philosopher Michael Oakeshott, one finds this observation: "The stirrings of love can be felt, like those of ambition, before we have an object.
>
> This is true particularly of the young ... [who are] in love with love." The original authority on the matter, the Roman poet Ovid, said as much when he pleaded women to be forgiving of men's awkward feints: 'O ye fair, be kinder to those who pretend: / That passion will become real, which began as feigned."¹6 We have seen how love is among the quintessential byproduct states: it cannot be willed; it must in fact be ‘fallen into'. And it is accordingly defined by disinterest: love is only judged to be real insofar as it is unpremeditated, uncalculated, unreasoned. Yet La Rochefoucauld and Oakeshott both reveal all the stage-setting that goes into that eventual loss of reason. Stoking our own passions out of a design that we then conveniently forget: it's not only possible, it's what all teenagers do. Their first encounters with love are aspirational, a rehearsal for the later fall. This is the intelligence scheming against itself, with the help of books and movies and cheesy pop songs. Then, once the fall occurs, it ceases to matter entirely that the groundwork was set ahead of time.* Having seen the light, do the newly devout unsee it by being reminded of their motives in coming to see it in the first place? Unlikely. Once a conversion is complete, a belief is internalised, and all means used to attain it come to be seen as valid, precisely for having attained it.
>
> So where La Rochefoucauld saw only reason for further cynicism, I instead see cause for hope. After all, what does it mean to believe in our passion enough to internalise its existence? To move ourselves into shedding tears and feeling sorrow? To coax ourselves into religious faith? Or to fall in love after hearing it sufficiently mentioned? How different are these states from true passion, sorrow, faith, and love? It sounds like a truism to claim that the most successful faker is the one who transforms himself into the genuine article. But in this case, it may offer a useful prescription for behaviour.modellen What La Rochefoucauld and the French Moralists denounced as hypocrisy looks quite different in light of the multiple self.
>
> We are not dealing so much with posturing, as with one inner self delegating to another. Both selves are in on the ploy. It's a peaceful transfer of power: an abdication rather than a usurpation. (Page 242)

> the discussion of fakers in Chapter 4, we assumed that people are either strategic fakers, or true passionates. But recognising the notion of the multiple self complicates this easy distinction. Consider the art market. We have seen how the wages of passion are highest in industries like academia, science, public service, and the arts: settings where there is a strong premium put on disinterested behaviour. Any contemporary artist who would let slip that they were merely trying to maximise sales by catering to their audience's tastes would immediately see those sales dwindle. Art derives its market valuation from its proclaimed lack of interest in that valuation. Yet in spite of this setup, most working artists are neither instrumental fakers nor disinterested passionates.
>
> Aware of the prevailing market expectation that art be made for its own sake rather than the market's, most artists may genuinely come to take this view as their own, even as part of them remains very much interested in the market's rewards. They succeed in channelling their instrumental impulses into noninstrumental directions, precisely because on some latent level, they know that such disinterest is also the way of appealing to the audience. There is a harmony between the passionate self and the instrumental self, and the latter lets itself be overtaken by the former, knowing that this also favours it. The suppression of one self results from collusion between the two. The intelligence defies itself because it pays to do so even by its own terms.
>
> Such artists would not think of themselves as posturing which makes it more likely that posturing, insofar as it is taking place, bears fruit.
>
> 37 Take the British street artist Banksy, mentioned in the first pages of this book as the archetype of an artist whose market success is premised on an open show of disinterest, if not complete disdain, in market success. Consider a representative Banksy work, titled Morons: a screen print featuring a crowded auction house, with the painting up for sale inscribed with the words 'I can't believe you morons actually buy this sh*t'. The work is based on a photograph of an actual 1987 sale of Vincent van Gogh's Sunflowers at Christie's, which in its day broke auction records. A print of Morons, one of a series of 300 in sepia (other series having been produced in a gamut of colours), recently sold for over $75,000 at the same Christie's auction house depicted in the print. Christie's was so visibly delighted with this self-referential wink that they titled the entire sale 'Banksy: I can't believe you morons actually buy this sh*t'. The morons in question presumably ate it up, since the Banksy sale, put up only minor works by the artist, and took place in the middle of the coronavirus pandemic in September 2020, brought it nearly $3 million. ¹8 (Page 245)

> Trusting in the 'custody of automatism' also brings to mind the unexpected embrace of routine often observed in prolific innovators and creative types, those who manage to tap the superhuman aspect of a mind in a state of 'pure leisure'. A sedate external existence, in this view, is what allows for a fervent inner one. Haruki Murakami, who is among the most wildly inventive novelists writing today - and one of my favourites - holds to this kind of unvarying regimen when he's working on a book.
>
> He gets up every day at 4 a.m., writes, goes for a run and then a swim, writes some more, and is in bed by 9 p.m. As he explains, I keep to this routine every day without variation. The repetition itself becomes the important thing; it's a form of mesmerism. I mesmerize myself to reach a deeper state of mind."¹4 William James, who not only trusted in habit, but also shared the late nineteenth-century fascination with mesmerism, or hypnosis, would be pleased. To 'mesmerise oneself', of course, implies a multiple self: one self is the mesmerist and the other the mesmerised. As it happens, the word 'mesmerise' comes from a certain Franz Mesmer, a pseudo-scientist from the eighteenth century who postulated the existence of a universal vital fluid contained in all living beings that could be tapped for instrumental purposes. Mesmer was a quack, but Murakami's dozen novels are real.
>
> Finally, Pascal and William James both draw our attention to the necessary role of time in the role of time in the passage from the reflective to the reflexive. What begins as volitional and effortful can, if performed sufficiently frequently, and for sufficiently long, take on the form of habits, and be progressively removed from the dominion of the intellect. Over time, the dance steps that begin as self-conscious calculation are progressively delegated to the motor functions. They become free, in the double sense of the word: both unrestricted, and costing us no conscious effort. As with Castiglione's sprezzatura, however, attaining that double freedom may require considerable effort at the outset. The best dancers are those who have all but forgotten what their feet are doing; but for the intellect to be able to recede in this way, it must first be granted its hours of deliberate, effortful action.
>
> When people are asked to shift modes, they tend to rely on the repetition of long-established, familiar rituals. Athletes thus run through the same set of gestures at crucial moments of play.
>
> Tennis players will bounce the ball a predetermined number of times before serving; basketball players go through a similar routine at the free-throw line. It is the intellect's way of summoning and giving way to muscle memory, the athlete's analogue to Pascal's 'animal reactions' and William James's 'nervous system'.

> As I returned from the residency, I experienced something similar to what Glück described after taking her teaching job.
>
> Oddly enough, with a newborn at home and the return of the usual never-ending to-do list, I felt less stifled than I had in my optimal mountain surroundings. Somehow, I found that ideas flowed more freely in the early morning, before a day of house chores and campus duties, than they had in the uninterrupted weeks of the residency.

> That experience affected the very conception I have of creative work. I began thinking of it as something that has to be surreptitiously pilfered from the day, rather than bought in the open. Obtained slightly dishonestly, under the covers rather than on schedule. I found it easier to write when I felt everyone else around me was still sleeping, unaware of my contrived efforts.
>
> of Yet this is not to say that my material circumstances were irrelevant - far from it. I was able to shift modes for a spell and steal time away during those mornings because I had benefited from a government-funded paternity leave from my university position, and because my partner was able to take a full year maternity leave from her job, which was also publicly subsidised.
>
> When our daughter ran a fever, we had public healthcare to fall back on. Later, we were able to put her in a state-sponsored daycare nursery across the street from our house, a full day of which costs less than a movie ticket on cheap Tuesdays. All these conditions contributed to the maintenance of a protected province of mental space that could be devoted to non-instrumental thinking. I no longer had an isolated mountain cabin to sit in all day or a ready buffet waiting at dinner time. Yet all the same I relied on highly favourable circumstances.
>
> Similarly, Glück found the worldly obligations that came with teaching oddly freeing. The daily constraints linked with living 'an authentic life' proved more enabling than not. But one can well imagine the effect would not have been so liberating if that authentic life consisted of working two limited-term teaching positions at two different places with long bus commutes to make ends meet. The demon of self-consciousness is one thing; the demon of economic precarity is quite another. The ideal environment, in this case, is one that manages to keep both at bay.

> The element of risk that is an inescapable part of noninstrumental pursuits implies a concrete role for social institutions. We actually know a great deal about how to handle risk: the conventional means of addressing it is through some form of insurance. So if individuals are less likely to pursue activities in a disinterested fashion because of the risk involved, then social and economic policies can step in to cover the downside.

> There is a wide range of public policies that accomplish this.

> People behave differently when they know that measures exist to catch them in the event of an unplanned shock. That awareness what matters most; it's the greatest benefit of insurance of any kind. Without professional liability insurance, surgeons would never pick up their scalpel; house movers would not venture to pick up your piano. Without car insurance, getting behind the wheel would be an unthinkably risky move that only the very rich could afford. All insurance is designed to have this enabling not otherwise engage in.

S. Eliot called 'autotelic' activities – those that are performed for their own sake. Can social provisions that cover downside risk be one way of fostering such activity, and might they increase the returns of individual passion in so doing?
>
> We are only now beginning to understand the relationship between social insurance and innovative activity. That's because until recently, economists were mostly concerned to see whether social insurance would have negative effects on individual behaviour. The idea was that by having less to lose, people might actually grow complacent, in ways that would inhibit productivity and growth. That concern has been convincingly put to rest."
>
> Scholars are now turning their attention to how well-designed social insurance might make individuals more willing to engage in risky activities with high returns.
>
> The ongoing findings from this research, which has focused especially on entrepreneurship, are promising. Social insurance provisions are associated with an increased number of start-ups in the economy, greater job mobility, and higher rates of selfemployment. They make it more likely, in other words, that those millennials mentioned in the previous chapter, who planned to quit their jobs for more meaningful work, are actually able to do so. The passage from lobbying exec to motorcycle repair is made easier when one's health insurance is not on the line. The effect of health insurance, as it happens, has received particular attention.

> Greater access to health insurance has been associated with more job mobility, as well as greater rates of entrepreneurial activity. In the specific context of the US, we also know that the way health insurance is most often linked to employers tends to deter individuals from striking out on their own, leading to what economists call 'job lock-in'.20 In sum, there is growing evidence that individuals become more willing to engage in activities that can lead to a temporary drop in earnings in settings that provide social insurance.²1 Measuring the effect of social insurance on individual behaviour effects is not easy. The difficulty stems from how national policies tend to come as packages: countries that offer social insurance also tend to have more highly regulated labour markets, for example, which may actually have opposite effects on risk-taking behaviour.22 We can point out that Sweden scores higher on innovation measures than the US, with more start-ups per capita, a greater portion of new firms in the market, and relatively more research and development spending. But it is difficult to pinpoint which aspect of the Swedish package deserves credit for this.

> Such naturally occurring experiments are one means of isolating the effect of a policy measure. For instance, New Jersey implemented a set of reforms in 1993 that resulted in more people having access to individual health insurance. When compared against neighbouring Pennsylvania, New Jersey then saw a significant rise (of some 25 per cent) in entrepreneurship and self-employment in the years following its reforms, while Pennsylvania saw no change over the same period.

Alaska provides one such natural laboratory, since it pays out annual dividends to residents from its sovereign wealth fund. The available data suggest that the Alaska Permanent Fund Dividend programme has in fact led to more entrepreneurial activity.²6 Similar effects for guaranteed income schemes have been observed in other settings, from India to Namibia.27 Of course, not all entrepreneurs are engaging in passion projects. Many are driven to self-employment by necessity. And most of them are behaving highly instrumentally - if not aiming for a unicorn start-up hit, then hoping at least to make enough to live on without a boss telling them what to do. Yet a significant portion of these individuals are also engaging in a form of experimentation, an attempt to combine their day job with a passion. As a result, they work late nights and early mornings, in ways they would not dream of doing at a regular office job.

> He argued that this was especially true for women and for the working class. 28 There was a natural progression in the passage from hired labour to self-employment. The result was not only greater economic efficiency, as individuals chose the tasks they were best suited for, but moral progress. Very much under the influence of Harriet Taylor's ideas, Mill associated the shift to tion of a space for autonomy, which he and Taylor envisioned as self-employment with self-emancipation, and with the cultivathe highest good. As Mill sensed at the time, social institutions played a key role in allowing for this shift. And we are now getting a better sense for exactly how they can achieve this.

> These humdrum policies health insurance, wage guarantees, unemployment insurance – all fall under the label of the social safety net. It's an expression that is used so often that we no longer stop to consider it. When we hear it mentioned, we know to quickly place ourselves for or against, depending on our ideological priors. But this keeps us from appreciating the term's radical aspect. Actual safety nets, after all, are not designed for people who trip while walking down the street. Safety nets exist to catch circus aerialists who fall from thirty feet while doing somersaults. That is, the term itself hints at a social mechanism that allows people to leap. It takes on its full meaning when it drives people to take risks they would not otherwise be willing to take. And recent studies offer empirical su (Page 284)
