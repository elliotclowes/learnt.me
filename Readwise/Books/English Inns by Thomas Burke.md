> IN the past a sharp distinction was drawn between the tavern and the inn ; they were controlled by laws peculiar to each other, and held a I different form of license. The tavern was restricted to providing casual refreshment, both food and drink, and was usually kept by a vintner.
>
> The inn was restricted to the receipt and entertainment of travellers by day and night. Neither was allowed to overlap the other. The tavern was forbidden to harbour guests; the inn was forbidden to allow itself to be used for "tippling" or as a place of idle resort. The tavern had to close at a certain hour; the inn had to be open at all hours. (Page 40)

> Here is an affectionate picture by a little-known American writer of the middle nineteenth century, Henry Tuckerman :
>
> “The coffee room of the best class of English inns, carpeted and curtained, the dark rich hue of the old mahogany, the ancient plate, the four-post bed, the sirloin or mutton joint, the tea, muffins, Cheshire and Stilton, the ale, the coal-fire and The Times, form an epitome of England; and it is only requisite to ponder well the associations and history of each of these items to arrive at what is essential in English history and character. The impassable divisions of society are shown in the difference between the "commercial" and the "coffee" room; the time-worn aspect of the furniture is eloquent of conservatism; the richness of the meats and strength of the ale explain the bone and sinew of the race ; the tea is fragrant with Cowper's memory, and suggestive of East India conquests ; the cheese proclaims a thrifty agriculture, the bed and draperies comfort, the coal-fire manufactures ; while The Times is the chart of English enterprise, division of labour, wealth, self-esteem, politics; trade, court-life, "inaccessibility to ideas" and bullyism.”

> To taste its full savour you should come to it on an evening of autumn or winter, when tired and chilled; not after a cooped and sedentary journey in a car but after a fairly stiff walk against the wind. At such a time the hall fire, glinting on old panels or even shabby old chairs, is a benediction, and the odours from the kitchen, and the glass and napkins of the lighted dining-room make a promise which in itself is delightful even if it is not fulfilled to your expectations. And the last half-hour in the lounge, and the last drink and chat with Boots, and the going up the old worn stairs, and absorbing the atmosphere of the old place, common and transitory incidents of travel as they are, make precious moments.

> The dinner the kitchen produced for you was, however, a little different from those of the past. Lusty travellers of the lusty days of the inn's youth would have considered it a mere snack; an appetiser to the meal proper. Even seventy years back a country-inn dinner for two people, quoted in a contemporary sketch, was-a turbot of four pounds weight, two roast ducks, an apple-pie, cheese and dessert. Breakfast was cold ham and beef, Cambridge sausages, fried eggs, followed by a roast mallard.
>
> At the end of the eighteenth century an inn dinner for one person (John Byng) was-spitch-cocked eels, roast pigeons, a loin of pork, tarts, jellies, custards and cheese. The dinners of the middle eighteenth century, if not of so many dishes, were even heavier in substance, and at the end of the seventeenth century eight or nine courses was usual. In the sixteenth century the dishes were, as mentioned earlier, many and various, and supported by all kinds of side-dishes which have long disappeared from our tables. The high feeding of those times was not due to gluttony. Diversions were few, and at the end of the day's journey there was little to fill the Ionely hours but eating and drinking.
>
> But with all this high feeding the inns of the past said little about their food. It seems to have been taken for granted that there would be a generous table, and there was no need to talk, as our inns of to-day do, of "butter and cream from our own farm,'" or "fruit from our own orchard," or "home-made honey and preserves." Nobody in those days expected the food to come from anywhere except the local fields. What was stressed is something of which to-day nothing is said. They stressed Good Beds -Comfortable Beds-Well-Aired Beds; and the warming-pan was always on view to re-assure those nervous travellers to whom damp sheets implied certain death. They also stressed Neat Wines, meaning wine unwatered, and Good Post-Horses, where to-day our inns stress Inspection Pit, H. & C. Basins and Gas-Fires in all bedrooms, American Bar and new Dance Floor.
