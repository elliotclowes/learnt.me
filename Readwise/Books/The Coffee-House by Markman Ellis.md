## Highlights
***

> The significant change in the nature of the coffee-house in Paris was initiated in 1676, when an Italian, Francesco Procopio dei Coltelli, established one at the annual St Germain fair. By 'setting off' his coffee room with 'tapestry, large peers of glass [mirrors], pictures, marble tables, branches for candles, and other ornaments', he was able to attract a much higher-status clientele. Success at the fair was translated into a more permanent establishment at rue de Tournon and, after 1686, in rue des Fossés-Saint-Germain, where the Café Procope still trades as a restaurant, advertising itself as the oldest in the world."
