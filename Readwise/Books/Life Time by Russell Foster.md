> A lot of people are talking about kava kava' to help with sleep and relaxation. Is there any evidence to support this?
>
> The history of kava kava is that it comes from the Pacific Islands and is consumed throughout the Pacific Ocean cultures, including in Polynesia, Hawaii, Vanuatu and Melanesia. The root of the plant is used to produce a drink with sedative and anaesthetic ties, and active ingredients are called 'kavalactones'. Interestingly, these kavalactones seem to enhance GABA (gamma-aminobutyric acid) pathways in the brain, which are also the targets of both the benzodiazepine (e.g. Diazepam (Valium), Chlordiazepoxide (Librium), Alprazolam (Xanax) and Z drugs (e.g. zopiclone, zaleplon and zolpidem), which are discussed in the next chapter. Kava kava drinks have become popular in Australia, New Zealand, the USA and Europe to help with relaxation and sleep. A major, although fairly old, review of published papers available up until 2003 concluded: 'Compared with placebo, kava extract appears to be an effective symptomatic treatment option for anxiety. The data available from the reviewed studies suggest that kava is relatively safe for short-term treatment (1 to 24 weeks), although more information is required. Further rigorous investigations, particularly into the long-term safety profile of kava, are warranted.'28¹ Studies on rats also suggest that kava extract can improve sleep in sleep-disturbed animals.282 So it is still early days, but kavalactones may provide a useful aid for sleep in the not too distant future (Page 116)

> In the absence of natural light, morning light exposure using a light box has also been shown to be helpful for circadian timing problems.
>
> There are many light boxes available on the market, and the main thing to look for is that they produce enough bright light, in the region of 2,000 lux or more (Figure 3, p. 61). The key point is that if you are an owl and want to become more of a 'morning person', seek out advancing morning light, but avoid delaying evening light (Page 120)

> Menstrual cycles can range from around 21 to 40 days, with only about 15 per cent of women having so-called 'normal' cycles of 28 days (Figure 5). This is a good example of why an 'average value'
>
> can be very misleading, and can even cause worry. It is in fact normal to have menstrual cycles different from 28 days. In about 20 per cent of women, cycles are irregular due to a range of factors, but, as we shall discuss, some of this irregularity may be linked to sleep and circadian rhythm disruption (SCRD). 347–8 Menstrual bleeding lasts 3–7 days, averaging five days.
