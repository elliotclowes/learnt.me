> The mind of a time is the joint output of leading minds of the time, in the form of their debates, ideas and discoveries. The story of the seventeenth-century mind is accordingly the story of its leading minds and their interactions.
>
> It is also the study of what made those interactions possible and often urgent. In hindsight we pigeonhole for our own convenience, and we overlook important details. We now talk of the scientific revolution, and differently we talk of philosophy in that period as shaping subsequent debate in epistemology, metaphysics and political theory, and thus we proceed as if the scientific and philosophical revolutions were not the same thing - or rather, constituent parts of one larger thing. But they were indeed parts of each other and jointly of the greater mental revolution of the age.
>
> Moreover, the revolution in question would not have been possible if it had not been possible for ideas to circulate, at least more freely than people could. So to understand how thought progressed in this period, we need to know about something seemingly so mundane as the postal services of the day. Significantly, there were several individuals who acted as - so to speak - internet servers connecting the savants of Europe to each other and facilitating the flow of information and exchange of ideas among them. One such was Marin Mersenne. His own varied work represents one of the signal features of the age's mental revolution, which was the effort to detach genuinely productive enquiry from the entanglements of mysticism, the occult, magic, Rosicrucianism – and of course from the proscriptions of religion, which was by sceptical questioning of its authority, and therefore hostile to the growth of secular knowledge and literacy.

> But now consider the publication in 1686 - just over fifty years the trial of Galileo - of the delightful and impressive Conversations on the Plurality of Worlds by Bernard le Bovier de Fontenelle, Cartesian philosopher and author of genius. Under the guise of conversations enjoyed during a series of evening walks with an aristocratic lady who remains anonymous, Fontenelle introduces and explains the nature of the universe as conceived by the seventeenth century's 'new philosophy', contrasting it to the geocentric view it displaced and drawing out the implications for humankind's self-understanding. The account he gives of the Copernican view was intended as a preface to his argument that because all stars are suns, it is likely that there are many planets revolving about them, bearing life - a view which in recent years has been given the support not just of statistics but of actual observation of planetary systems other than our own and planets like our own. (Page 9)

> It is not just from our perspective that the seventeenth century appears as a revolutionary time. As the example of Fontenelle shows, it presented itself as such to its own inhabitants. Consider the excitement of Jeremiah Horrocks and his friend William Crabtree on 24 November 1639 when, shut in the latter's attic, they made a spectacular scientific observation: a transit of Venus - that is, the visible passage of the planet Venus across the face of the sun. Horrocks had worked out the date of the transit by studying Kepler's Rudolphine Tables of planetary motion, published twelve years earlier. It was a classic case of testing a theory by observation. Imagine the feelings of the two amateurs as they waited for iterated proof of Copernicus' system and by significant implication, of a universe far different from its portrayal in traditional belief. They saw what they expected to see, and yet could hardly credit that they were seeing it: the black dot of Venus inching its way across the brilliant image of the sun projected onto a card in Crabtree's attic.
>
> Horrocks described his friend as standing 'rapt in contemplation' for a long time, unable to move, 'scarcely trusting his senses, through excess of joy'. The emotion he and Crabtree felt is one well known to science: the exhilaration of seeing empirical confirmation of theory.¹
>
> Horrocks and Crabtree knew of course that they were not making a discovery. Copernicus' work and Galileo's telescopes had between them already refuted the claim in Psalm 104 verse 5, cited by Bellarmino to Foscarini, that the earth had been 'set on its foundations, so that it should never be moved'. What was new was that Horrocks and Crabtree were interpreting what they witnessed a planet travelling on an inner orbit between the earth and the sun according to an account of the universe's structure radically different from predecessor accounts; and with it a completely different set of implications for everything else humanity thought, hoped and wished to believe. (Page 11)

Note: My thought: Psalm 104 verse 5 says that the earth had been ‘set on its foundations, so that it should never be moved’. I think lines like this is one of the reasons I really struggle to believe anyone can be believers of any of the offered models. You’re turning your life over to a book, and taking it as quite literally gospel, and they are frequently factually incorrect. And incorrect about a big one: the ‘creation’ of the Earth. How can you believe anything else that’s said when they get _that_ wrong‽ p12

> The first example is an event in our solar system known as the 'Late Heavy Bombardment'. Nearly 4 billion years ago the inner solar system was subjected to an immense hailstorm of meteors and asteroids. So many collided with the moon that they melted its surface. Mercury was especially badly hit; vast craters like the Caloris Basin were ringed by volcanoes after the impact, and shock waves raised strangely shaped hills on the planet's far side. Given that the earth also lay in the path of this cataclysmic shower of debris falling into the sun, it too suffered. More than 1,700 craters of diameter greater than twenty kilometres were formed on the moon by the Late Heavy Bombardment, so it is calculated that, given the earth's larger size, more than ten times as many giant craters were formed here. Deep sediments in Canada and Greenland contain an abundance of extraterrestrial isotopes, which give empirical support to the Bombardment hypothesis; and moreover the fact that, according to the fossil record, life began soon after the Bombardment suggests either that an earlier emergence of life was obliterated by it and had to start over, or that life was brought to our planet by the huge rocks that collided with it.
