> .Clocks of the sort on which Milton wrote were still rare, and they measured the hours with only wavering accuracy, providing little purchase on the smaller units of minutes and seconds into which they were divided. For this reason rhythms, both of music and of the human body, often had a very practical role in measuring time. Recipe books, if they needed to tell their readers how long to undertake a given action, would often say things like: ‘Let it remain boiling, while your pulse beateth two hundred strokes' or The water is to remain upon it, no longer than whiles you can say the Miserere psalm very leisurely.'¹ (Page 61)

> Many of the works encountered at school recurred, of the habits of mind inculcated there - repetition, memorisation, breaking texts down into parts to understand them and turn them into ready-packaged wisdom - returned, and were deepened and broadened. If this was how things worked year to year, it was underpinned by an extraordinary degree of day-to-day micromanagement, in both time and space: students were to speak Latin at all times within the college walls, and they were to leave these walls as seldom as possible, doing so only with a friend and with their tutor's permission - Christ's even employed a barber and a washerwoman to reduce the need to walk abroad. By 5 a.m. each day students were gathered for prayer in the chapel, and university lectures filled the morning, with breakfast and lunch eaten communally. The afternoons were freer, in theory, but Christ's required additional teaching by the fellows before service in chapel at 6 p.m., supper in hall, and the gates to be locked at 8 p.m., or an hour later in summer. 25 These arrangements not only ensured orderliness in time and space but also reflected a rigidly hierarchical social order that was reinforced at every communal meal. Students were divided into categories: the richest and most socially elevated, the Fellow Commoners, had the (no doubt dubious) privilege of eating with the fellows; the poorest, the Sizars, would partly earn their keep by serving food at table to the Fellow Commoners and the middle group, the Pensioners, to which Milton belonged. It's easy to see how this intensely regulated set-up might produce a strange mixture of claustrophobia and loneliness, of always being with others and always feeling alone. When Desiderius Erasmus, architect of the curriculum and ethos at St Paul's School, moved to Cambridge in the early sixteenth century, he complained loudly to friends about the low quality of the fellows' intellect and the local beer, calling it 'a snail's life. We shrink and hide ourselves indoors, and are as busy as bees in study. There is a great solitude here, most people away for fear of plague; though when all are here it is still a solitude.'26 Four centuries later William Empson, who wrote with piercing and eccentric brilliance about Milton's poetry while decrying his Christian theology, was thrown out of Magdalene College for the crime of being caught owning condoms as a young fellow.

> Most intriguingly, he [John Milton] kept in contact with Alexander Gil the Younger, continuing their 'almost constant conversations'. 29 Gil would become mired in controversy while Milton was maintaining their friendship, in a manner that confirms both the surveillance culture that prevailed in university colleges and the way in which national politics permeated their walls. In August 1628, days after the assassination of the Duke of Buckingham, Gil was drinking with friends in the cellar of Trinity College, Oxford, when he proposed a toast to Buckingham's killer, John Felton, and apparently mocked the king himself, saying that he had been 'led so long by the Duke': ‘we have a fine wise king,' he unwisely continued, he has wit enough to be a shopkeeper to ask "what do you lack" and that is all.'30 Gil's words, reducing Charles's thoughts to the cries of common stallholders, were overheard by William Chillingworth, a fellow of the college who was, unfortunately for Gil, Archbishop Laud's godson (Chillingworth would go on to become an important theologian in his own right). He reported Gil, who was dragged from his schoolroom in September, imprisoned in the Tower, and sentenced to a huge fine and to have his ears cut off, one at Oxford, one in London.³¹ It was only thanks to his father's desperate petitions that Gil escaped this grisly fate. Milton wrote nothing about these events, but his friend and former teacher's travails suggested the impact that loose words spoken within the confines of a college could have. (Page 131)

> Mede's letters show the way in which, within the pressured atmosphere of the time that Milton was at Cambridge, events that might strike us now as either weird curiosities or scholarly minutiae were loaded with heightened religious and political significance. In the summer of 1626 a fish was gutted in the market at Cambridge and a half-digested religious book was found within its abdomen.
>
> Mede witnessed its emergence himself and identified the book in question, writing avidly to Stuteville: 'I send my Lady the Fish-book bound in the same order it was taken out of the Fishes belly.'40 The debates about what this bizarre discovery meant, however, got mixed up with wider discussions of portents and omens including an earthquake in March 1626 and a storm in London that washed corpses from their graves - that might have suggested God's anger at the state of England, with its king in thrall to his hated favourite Buckingham and his Catholic wife; how one interpreted the 'Fishbook' became a sign of one's political stance.4¹ The following year a Dutchman named Isaac Dorislaus arrived at Cambridge to take up a newly endowed professorship of history.
>
> Dorislaus chose to lecture on the Roman historian Tacitus modern eyes, not the most controversial of choices. But in fact it was explosive: Tacitus had discussed the basis of republican government, of civil liberty, and the grounds on which tyranny could be resisted, and had influenced the feared and admired political philosophy of Machiavelli. Dorislaus presented the Roman's thought in the boldest of terms, endorsing his claim that it is better 'to live with the inconveniences of liberty than to live as slaves subject to the offensive pride of kings'.4² The lectures were a sensation and a scandal: Laud's allies in Cambridge complained to him, his foes defended Dorislaus, and finally the Dutchman was prevented from lecturing. He would eventually participate in the prosecution of Charles I, putting into practice the resistance to tyrants that he'd advocated at Cambridge, and was shortly afterwards stabbed to death in The Hague by English royalists while on a diplomatic mission.43 The fact that mere lectures on Roman history could allow such dangerous opinions to be aired and debated can help us make sense of the later attempt by the philosopher Thomas Hobbes to blame the outbreak of the English Civil Wars on the universities, which, he insisted, were 'the core of rebellion' and 'have been to this nation, as the wooden horse was to the Trojans', since the teaching of 'arguments for liberty out of the works of Aristotle, Plato, Cicero, Seneca, and out of the histories of Rome and Greece' had been allowed to infect the minds of the gentry.44 By no means was everyone with a classical education a radical - but such an education was far from intrinsically conservative, and could fuel the convictions of those who would resist a tyrannical monarch in the most violent ways.

> But eventually the words were written, and would stand as the opening of the greatest and the strangest poem he had written up to that point in his life; the best short poem, in my and many others' opinion, that he would ever write; perhaps the greatest short in English, while certainly one of the weirdest. A poem to poem which I keep returning with undiminished wonder and disquiet, which I wish I could recite in its entirety but cannot. Instead I have snatches, phrases, some entire sections, rattling around my mind, often at the back of it, sometimes at the front. It begins as follows:
>
> > Yet once more, O ye laurels and once more
>
> > Ye myrtles brown, with ivy never sere,
>
> > I come to pluck your berries harsh and crude, 
>
> > And with forced fingers rude,
>
> > Shatter your leaves before the mellowing year. (Page 146)

> The longest and most complex of these exercises shows Milton once again leaping deftly between modes and languages, but doing so not as part of a serious academic occasion, but during a time for approved foolery - a slice of learned silliness. This was a 'Salting', a rite of passage that was particularly popular when Milton was at Cambridge, in which first-year students delivered a speech (usually in Latin). If it met with approval, they were rewarded with beer; if not, they would have to down heavily salted beer (the Latin for salt, sales, was often used to mean wit). (Page 156)

> The deeper problem was that it wasn't entirely clear what it would mean, for someone in Milton's position, to devote himself to poetry in the manner that he implored his father to allow him to do. It wasn't clear what kind of activity, what kind of work, the writing of poetry was: what a life devoted to it should look like.
>
> It was neither respectable nor plausible to announce oneself as a poet-prophet, especially when one was an unknown university student. As the poet-critic John Hollander puts it: 'A poet's work can appear to be very strange. It can look, for example, like a manual labourer's utter respite from work (sitting in a rocking chair, thinking, remembering, muttering, humming).'4° None of these activities were likely to impress the ambitious, financially savvy, and upwardly mobile father who had paid for Milton's education as a decent return on his investment.
>
> One option was to write for the commercial theatre, which Milton had certainly experienced, and with which he had various connections. In an earlier poem to Diodati he had described his delight in watching 'raging Tragedy' (furiosa Tragoedia) unfold on the London stage - 'It makes me sad to watch, yet watch I do, and find a pleasure in the sadness.'4¹ His father was a trustee of the Blackfriars playhouse, and probably helped secure the commission for Milton's first published poem, 'On Shakespeare', which I discussed in the introduction to this book. In 'L'Allegro', Milton praised 'the well-trod stage' and especially 'sweetest Shakespeare, fancy's child'. The thrilling recent discovery of Milton's annotated copy of Shakespeare shows how carefully he read the playwright's works, adding comments in the margins and correcting printing errors.4² But despite these serious forms of engagement, nothing suggests that grubbing around in the commercial world of the theatre would satisfy his poetic ambitions. (Page 162)

> I have said that 'Lycidas' sends out its shoots and tendrils to later writers; given how widely and deeply Milton was read in nineteenth-century America, it seems not unlikely to me that the poem's gorgeously resurgent 'day-star', its 'new-spangled' beams flaming across the morning sky, left its mark in the mind of the amateur poet Francis Scott Key when he first scribbled down the lyrics to 'The Star-Spangled Banner'. (Page 165)

> I've already alluded to the activity that took up most of Milton's time in Horton, when he was not writing poems of his own: reading - avidly, voraciously, exhaustively, and exhaustingly. Emerging from Cambridge with his potential vocations in tatters, he prevailed upon his parents' patience and their relative wealth, living with them while he continued his studies, but in an idiosyncratic and selfdirected Years later he wrote, looking back at this time:
>
> > On my father's estate, whither he had retired in old age, I spent my whole time at leisure [otium] in turning over the Greek and Latin authors; although I occasionally exchanged the country for the city, either for the sake of purchasing books, or for learning something new in mathematics or in music, in which I at that time delighted.
>
> This is an idealised account, produced at a moment in his life when Milton, by then a prominent advocate of regicide, was defending his reputation to a European audience. But even if he did not spend his 'whole time at leisure' (he continued to be involved in his father's financial affairs, not to mention the writing of Comus), reading certainly dominated his time and took most of his energies. His surviving commonplace book records only the tip of this iceberg `of effort, and even that is staggering: snippets culled from countless pages and tomes, wide and various in scope, but dominated in particular by theology, especially the writings of the Church Fathers, and by ancient, medieval, and more recent history. These complex and forbidding works were seasoned and leavened by Italian literature, especially the poetry of Dante and Ariosto (Page 189)

> When the vicar finished and found us, he agreed to let us into the library, which, it turned out, was accessed through this same painted area. The wooden walls themselves, he told us, had been built by the Kedermister family, who were minor local nobility, to contain their private pew; they could access it by a side door, which meant that they would at no point have to share the same holy space as the poor and lowly parishioners. It was a monument, I thought as I stood inside it, to the claustrophobia to which snobbishness and disdain leads. These were people who preferred lurking in their ornate box over praying communally, visible to the painted eyes of God but not to the poor. (Page 191)

> One obvious riposte to this account of Milton's 'latent homosexuality' is that the category of homosexuality is a much later invention – not that people of the same biological sex in the seventeenth century did not love or have sex with one another, but that the idea of an intrinsically homosexual person is not formulated until the late nineteenth century. Another is that the intense, passionate friendship between Milton and Diodati was entirely in keeping with the norms and practices of seventeenth-century friendship, which often involved men embracing, kissing, sharing beds, professing their love for one another as a kind of spiritual marriage. The Anglican priest Jeremy Taylor wrote that 'the love of friends [must] sometimes be refreshed with material and low caresses; lest by striving to be too divine it become less humane.'¹6 Friendship between learned men, one of the crucial ways in which social and political relationships were publicly managed, was always unstable and ambiguous, and it was by virtuoso navigation of this instability that men proved their sophistication." But I find myself dissatisfied by both of these responses, which feel in different ways like evasions, ways not just of respecting historical difference but of hiding behind it. (Page 198)

> suggested that their school curriculum tended to destabilise the very forms of manhood that it sought to create. Above all, it assumes that we know what it is to be 'just friends'. To assume that Milton's friendship with Diodati either must or must not have had a sexual element because it was uniquely intense is to assume, falsely, that we know what sexuality and friendship are when we encounter them, and that we can always distinguish between them. Another way to put this would be that the course of an intense, formative friendship belongs within, but also has the power to alter and transform, the intense knot of rhythms that makes up a life. The psychoanalyst Theodor Reik, pondering the fact that Takt, a social virtue, also refers in German to musical time or rhythm, suggested that 'happy love is largely dependent upon the temporal concordance of the individual rhythm of two human beings'.26 Milton and Diodati, I would say, seem in their friendship, and in the letters and poems they exchanged, to have achieved this temporal concordance, the meshing of their respective rhythmic knots. Perhaps this is just a complicated way of saying, again, that Diodati was the love of Milton's life. But in saying this, I want to keep the nature of this love actively open: neither to decide that it must or must not have been sexual, nor to throw up my hands and say we can't know, and move on, leaving our assumptions unchanged; but rather to make our continued not-knowing into the reason to read their exchanges of letters and poems, and to care about their shared love after nearly four hundred years. The reason these early writings matter to me is because they hold out the promise of other ways of relating, other forms of relationship, from those that I already know how to categorise and can therefore anticipate; new rhythms of love. (Page 201)

> Travel for leisure and self-cultivation was even more the privilege of the very few in his lifetime than it is today, but it was also, in a deeper sense than is easy to appreciate today, a true risk. I don't mean just the routine perils of drowning or robbery or illness, but an existential risk in and of itself. Various theories, lingering in adapted forms from classical writings, still understood people as temperamentally bound to the land and the climate into which they were born: for an English person to exchange the cold and damp of northern Europe for the dry heat of the Mediterranean could be severely perilous. The aim of travel was to return a different person from when you left; but there was always the risk that this transformation could be excessive, unsettling, monstrous (Page 206)

> Whereas I wouldn't necessarily urge you to go out of your way to visit Bread Street, Horton, or the Hotel Astoria, I would wholeheartedly recommend Vallombrosa if you ever have the opportunity to go. Part of the excitement even before we arrived was the sense of joining a long list of literary pilgrims who'd made the journey with Milton in mind in earlier centuries. They included some of his most famous admirers. William Wordsworth wrote a pretty poor poem, 'At Vallombrosa', which noted of Milton's visit that 'The Monks still repeat the tradition with pride, / And its truth who shall doubt?'43 Mary Shelley, who would later make the reworking of Paradise Lost's exploration of creation and separateness central to her novel Frankenstein, arrived at the monastery soaked by sleet, and the monks plied her with coffee and rosolio, the rose petal liqueur that they distilled. She had better luck than the poet Elizabeth Barrett Browning, who hoped to spend three months there but was turned back by the monks, who wouldn't allow a female to be resident a reminder that, as with Virginia Woolf's experience with the Trinity Manuscript, following Milton's footsteps has often been a very different experience for women and men.45 But I'd also been intrigued to discover figures less readily associated with Milton who knew of his connection with the place - like the philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche, who in November 1885 wrote to his mother from Florence of his plan to 'retreat into the wood-, mountain-, and cloistersolitude of Vallombrosa the place is famous: Dante and Milton have glorified it, the latter in his description of paradise.” (Page 238)

> Naples had, when Milton visited, the largest population of any city in southern Europe - more than three hundred thousand people, four times the size of Rome, and smaller only than London and Paris across the entire Continent. (Page 244)

> On a more mundane level, however, the story interests me because it shows that, at least at this point, the watch's beats were heard as Tick. This is time not as a series of the same: Tick Tick ● my alternating pairs, but as the constant repetition of the same, and hunch is that tick-tock as a convention gradually developed as a way of coping with, or fending off, this feeling of endless repetition, of never-ending sameness. As Frank Kermode puts it: 'We ask what [a clock] says: and we agree that it says tick-tock. By this fiction we humanize it, make it talk our language. Of course, it is we who provide the fictional difference between the two sounds: tick is our word for a physical beginning, tock is our word for an end.'¹5 While Kermode acknowledges that tick-tock by itself is 'not much of a plot', he nonetheless sees it as the basis for all of our plots: our desires to shape and organise time, to give it an order and a form that is varied but predictable. Though Kermode does not use the word, I'd again say that what tick-tock does, by introducing a difference of a single letter, is give time a rhythm.
