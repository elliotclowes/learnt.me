> As many as 70 or 80 per cent of boys in Florence attended school a much higher rate than in other European cities. Note: in the 1430s. (Page 5)

> One of the first people to take an interest in Vespasiano, to draw him into this charmed circle of wise and valorous men, was a cardinal named Giuliano Cesarini. Vespasiano would have been about sixteen when the two of them met in Michele Guarducci's bookshop.
>
> Cardinal Cesarini was a distinguished scholar and teacher, a former law professor at the prestigious university in Padua. Though he came from a noble and ancient Roman family, Cesarini had suffered poverty in his student days. He had been forced to copy out his own textbooks because he could not afford to buy them and, when he served as tutor to the sons of a wealthy family, had collected the stubs of candles after their splendid banquets in order to prolong his studies into the evening - for the acquisition of knowledge in those days required not just books but also a good supply of candles to read by.
>
> Cesarini was always on the lookout, therefore, for students whose intellectual abilities were inversely proportional to their financial means. He evidently spotted in Vespasiano an able and enthusiastic pupil, and an intimacy grew between them - the one an adolescent working for a bookbinder, the other a forty-year-old cardinal who had travelled all across Europe, from Oxford to Krakow, on business for the pope. One day he made the young man a tempting offer: he would foot the bill for Vespasiano's studies to become a priest. He gave him fifteen days to decide and, after the elapsed time, came for his answer. 'I told him I did not wish to become a priest,' Vespasiano later recalled. The cardinal was magnanimous in defeat. 'He responded that if he could ever help me,' Vespasiano wrote, he would do so.'
>
> Cardinal Cesarini proved unable to fulfil his promise, because a few years later he would die in battle against the Turks in eastern Bulgaria. His remains were never recovered from the battlefield beside the Black Sea, but his funeral oration was preached before the pope in Rome by his friend, the scribe and scholar Poggio Bracciolini, who worked in the Roman Curia, the papal bureaucracy.

> His remains were never recovered from the battlefield beside the Black Sea, but his funeral oration was preached before the pope in Rome by his friend, the scribe and scholar Poggio Bracciolini, who worked in the Roman Curia, the papal bureaucracy. Poggio may have been the one who brought the cardinal into Guarducci's shop and first introduced him to Vespasiano. He was from the country, the son of a spice merchant in a village thirty miles south-east of Florence, but he always signed his name 'Poggio Florentinus,' proudly identifying himself with the city to which, in about 1400, at the age of twenty, with only a few coins in his pocket, he had moved for his studies. He had finished his training as a notary, worked briefly as a scribe, then gone to Rome to find employment in the Curia. Here he worked, unhappily and for little pay, dreaming of a life 'free from the bustle of civilisation,' with plenty of leisure for writing books and, even more, for collecting them (Page 9)

> * The florin was a gold coin, first minted in Florence in 1252, weighing 3.536 grams. The silver coinage in Florence was the soldo, which steadily decreased in value against the florin. At the beginning of the fifteenth century a florin was worth seventy-five soldi; by 1500, one hundred and forty. Milan, Venice and Rome each had their own gold coin, the ducat, of equivalent weight and value to the florin.
