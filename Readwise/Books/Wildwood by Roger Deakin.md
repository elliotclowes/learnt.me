> I drive south across the county to the valley of the Stour on the borders of Essex where my friend Ronald Blythe lives in the old farmhouse he inherited from his friends John and Christine Nash. He has invited me to join him and a group of friends at their bluebell picnic. Each year, on the last Sunday in April, they gather in Tiger Wood, a mile or two up the valley, to raise teacups and glasses to spring, as announced by bluebells. (Page 35)

> We could be walking in the eighteenth century,' says Ronald, who thinks the bluebells 'jazzy, in a way': too blue and intense for his taste. He and Rosemary remember how, in less botanically correct times, people regarded it as almost a duty to pick as many as you could. I remember the trail of trodden, slippery stalks that used to litter the paths back to suburban Watford through Cassiobury Park from the wild Whippendell Woods each spring.

> How does a moth experience the swooning scent of so many bluebells? In the soft light of the wood they glow like phosphorescent waters, casting a misty blue penumbra like the moon's at a change in the weather. It blurs the blue meniscus lapping at the trees, obscuring the ground, floating them. Geoffrey Grigson thinks that the loveliness of the bluebell is not so much an individual beauty but the striking impression of many plants growing together, splashing a big area with their own uniform colour. Poppies can also be spectacular in this way. During the 1880s so many people crowded on to trains from London to see the hotly blushing hilltops above the cliffs from Cromer to Overstrand that the resort was successfully promoted as 'Poppyland'. Snowdrops, wood anemones, primroses, foxgloves and ramsons can all infuse woods with colour through sheer force of numbers. Yet the individual flower of the bluebell has a special pre-Raphaelite beauty, hanging upside down from the stem, bending it into a shepherd's crook. (Page 38)

> As a wood engraver, John Nash's botanical triumph is the celebrated Poisonous Plants, Deadly, Dangerous and Suspect, published in 1927. In a review of an edition of Nash woodcuts in Hortus in 1988, Ronald Blythe writes:
>
> > His garden was always plentifully supplied with henbane, hemlock, monk's hood, foxglove, meadow saffron, spurge laurel, datura, caper spurge, herb Paris, Helleborus foetidus and other such species which he had often been found staring at, much as one might at a murderer. He was proud, not only of their robust growth, but of their capabilities, and I have often watched him cast a wary eye over the gaunt reaches of the henbane. Gardens were not entirely benign places to him; they contained their darker moments. (Page 41)

> As Ronald and I walked through Tiger Wood that winter's day, following a stream along the valley, he spoke of the woods as havens for intimacy in the past. All country children, he said, were conceived in woods, because the cottages were simply too full of other people. Children, grandparents and others lived huggermugger in the cramped rooms, so couples adjourned to the woods for privacy. (Page 44)
