> Bearing in mind this important exception, sleeping on the back was near universally condemned.3 The objections of most medical practitioners were based on a mixture of humoral physiology and knowledge of brain function. Thomas Cogan spoke for many when he wrote that sleeping upon which the Child may therefore rest with Safety and Ease ...

An excess of moisture in the brain, which was the body's coldest gan, was further aggravated if the sleeper's uncovered head lay in the direct line of the moon's rays since the moon was understood to be a cold and moist planet. This was one very practical reason for the widespread use of nightcaps in bed, which moderated the brain's heat and helped to prevent it from flooding. (Page 27)

Resting first on the right side, which w hotter than the left, allowed food to descend more easily into the pit of the stomach, close to the liver, where it generated heat during the initial stage of digestion.4 Turning onto the cooler left side of the body after a few hours released the stomach vapours that had accumulated on the right and spread the heat more evenly through the body. This advice was prominent in both printed and manuscript healthcare guides and in recipe books, which were familiar household objects that contained a combination of culinary and medical recipes for everyday use.25 References to sleep posture were, however, rarely worthy of note in diaries or letters. English folk beliefs nevertheless suggest that there was a widespread perception of a right and a wrong way to lie in bed, and to rise from it. Rising on the right rather than the left side of the bed was considered by some to be an unlucky omen for the day ahead. Church of England clergyman John Gaule poured scorn on this notion in an astrological text of 1652, deeming it folly 'to bode good or bad luck, fortune, successe, from the rising up on the right, or left side."

> Despite Gaule's objections, this familiar idiom had antecedents stretching back to ancient Rome and the health implications of poor sleep posture may well be the cultural root of the modern expression 'to get out of ue wrong side of bed', which is generally associated with waking up in a bae mood. Since physicians encouraged sleepers to spend the second part of u night on their left side, rising on the right may suggest that body and mine had become disordered by a failure to heed this advice.

Thomas Cogan declared that to lie 'groveling was unhealthy since it impeded digestion.
