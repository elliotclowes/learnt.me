## Highlights
***

> His brother, Bruce 'did some quiet arithmetic'. The results were astonishing.
>
> There were two sorts of Hamilton consumption: town and country, Up in London, Bruce reckoned, his brother would begin the day in his Albany apartment with several large measures of whisky.
>
> Leaving the flat for a pub or restaurant, he would have 'at least four doubles ... in the evening perhaps the score would be eight or ten.
>
> His daily consumption can seldom have fallen far below the equivalent of three bottles.' In the country he eased off somewhat, substituting pre-lunch beer for scotch, but still averaging a bottle of scotch a day, every day.
>
> Bruce estimated the considerable monetary outlay. Whisky was hard to come by during the war and the official price for a bottle was a little over a pound, although the black-market price could be more than three pounds. Assuming an average daily consumption at two bottles a day, Hamilton was laying out about two thousand pounds a year for just his basic intake. When the costs are added of individual drinks bought in bars, meals, sixty cigarettes a day, tips to bar staff, waiters, taxi drivers and others, a conservative budget of four thousand pounds a year would probably have to be allowed for.
>
> It is difficult to put this into modern terms spirits have not increased by anything like the rate of general inflation, by only about ten times, whereas general inflation rises are nearer thirty times â€“ but a total of something like forty thousand pounds a year must be nearly equivalent.
>
> Hamilton was often hopelessly drunk by late evening and it would seem that on his heaviest days little if any work could be accomplished.
>
> For his last two major works, Hangover Square and The Slaves of Solitude, Hamilton evolved a routine of writing in bed for six or seven hours a day, only drinking in the evenings. The results were probably his finest works.
