> Frederick was also determined that his own children - of whom there were nine born between 1737 and 1751 - should be brought up as British. At a ball he threw for his eldest daughter Princess Augusta's third birthday at Cliveden in Buckinghamshire, the country house he leased for the summer months, Frederick commissioned Thomas Arne to compose the music for The Masque of Alfred about the ninth-century English monarch Alfred the Great, a piece today best known for its powerful finale, ‘Rule, Britannia’. (Page 8)

> Despite being fated always to be in political opposition - such was the patronage and power available to the governments of the eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries that they rarely lost general elections - Frederick had a strong sense of what he wanted to achieve when he became king, and a natural sense of public relations. He would walk the streets unattended by bodyguards, he would drink at the local public houses around Cliveden and he was ready to enter, in the words of one near-contemporary, 'the cottages of the poor, listen with patience to their twice-told tales, and partake with relish of the [ir] humble fare', leaving them with a few guineas as well as his friendly regards.¹4 On 27 June 1743, when George was five years old, his grandfather became the last British king to command an army in person, defeating the French at the battle of Dettingen in the War of Austrian Succession. The thirty-six-year-old Frederick's request to take part in the campaign had been ignored by his father. Instead, the King's third and favourite son, Prince William Augustus, Duke of Cumberland, was given a corps to command and was severely wounded in the leg by a musket ball. He became a national hero, but it caused bad blood between him and Frederick that would fester for years (Page 8)

> The monarch was the head of eighteenth-century governments, which tended to be formed by factions formed around prominent individuals; there were no political parties based on delineated ideology in the modern sense. Cabinet ministers considered themselves to be directly responsible to the King rather than to a prime minister and there was no concept of a Loyal Opposition, merely the supporters of factions that were not in government, whose exclusion from power and influence was underlined by the fact that the King did not invite them to Levees and Drawing Rooms, and they were therefore consigned to the political wilderness. Honours, patronage and sinecures were reserved solely for government supporters, hence the constant jockeying for position among the factions that so characterized the politics of the era.

> Neither the Whigs nor the Tories were political parties in anything approaching the modern sense of the term, in that a member of Parliament would consider himself to be not so much primarily a Whig or Tory MP as a county or borough MP, or a friend of Mr Pelham, or a Court supporter, and so on. Whigs and Tories had separate political philosophies, but it was not until the nineteenth century that MPs identified themselves through ideology as opposed to faction (Page 13)

> There had been no fatherly love whatever, as they both knew. 'I have lost my eldest son,' George II said at the end of the year, 'but I was glad of it.350 As for Frederick's burial, the King merely 'ordered the bowels to be put in a box' and three days later the undertakers had still not taken the box or the body away. The bowels not yet sewed up nor the body embalmed,'

> Egmont noted in his diary, 'a scandalous neglect. The smell is to be perceived over the whole house and descended even into Prince George's apartment.'51 The key new relationship in British politics - that between George II and his grandson and heir apparent Prince George - therefore started off with the Prince subjected to the stench of his father's rotting corpse thanks to his grandfather's neglect.

> The funeral took place in the Henry VII Chapel at Westminster Abbey on the afternoon of 13 April 1751. It was a cutprice affair, one mourner noting that 'no organ went, nor was there any anthem.352 George and his siblings were considered too young to attend, and, aside from Augusta, the official chief mourner at the funeral was the nonroyal Duke of Somerset as the rest of the royal family and senior aristocracy, taking their cue from the King, stayed away; except for the pall-bearers there were no English lords, one lone bishop and only two privy councillors. 53 The procession was rained upon as no one had thought to erect a canopy between the House of Lords and the Abbey. Nor were there any catering arrangements, so Dodington, a friend of the Prince, and the Prince's former lords of the bedchamber were obliged to send out 'for a great cold dinner from a common tavern in the neighbourhood'.54 (Page 19)

> her to get to Frederick, but treated her as a friend in her own right.76 John Bute was tall, handsome and charming. It was said of him that in all high society Lord Bute had the finest calves'." George II, who was never short of rude remarks about his son's friends, said of Bute that he would have made 'an excellent ambassador in any court where there was nothing to do'.78 Bute was the nephew of the 2nd and 3rd Dukes of Argyll and, after attending Eton and Leiden University, was from 1737 to 1741 one of the Scottish representative peers in the House of Lords. Afterwards he returned to his large but low-income estate on the Isle of Bute in Scotland. When he appeared in London in 1746 it was said he was so poor that he could hardly afford to keep his own carriage, then considered the most basic social prerequisite for an aristocrat.

> Bute was artistic and intelligent, and had a genuine interest in philosophy, mechanics, metaphysics and natural science. Later, his collection of mathematical apparatuses at his country seat at Luton Hoo in Bedfordshire was considered one of the most complete of its kind in Europe.7⁹ He was a cultured, discerning and tasteful man, ideally suited to be the moral tutor and mentor of a future king, but fundamentally ill-suited to the often undignified rough-and-tumble of eighteenth-century high politics. Bute also suffered from a problem that the political elite and the popular mob alike could never forgive: he was a Scot.
>
> Bute was descended from an illegitimate branch of the Stuart kings of Scotland, and only a decade after the Jacobite rebellion there were many who still loathed and feared Scots, despite England and Wales having been in a legislative union with Scotland since 1707 and a union of the two Crowns having existed since 1603. Augusta nonetheless appointed Bute as George's tutor in the early summer of 1755, and suddenly the Prince of Wales' education turned from a boring but conscientious slog into a thing of delight. It was wrong to suggest, as Sir Lewis Namier did in 1953, that the boy spent joyless years in a well-regulated nursery, the nearest approach to a concentration camp,' but he had not been excited intellectually until Bute arrived.
