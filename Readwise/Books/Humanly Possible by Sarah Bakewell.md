- Summary: The bestselling author of How to Live and At the Existentialist Café explores seven hundred years of writers, thinkers, scientists, and artists, all trying to understand what it means to be truly humanHumanism is an expansive tradition of thought that places shared humanity, cultural vibrancy, and moral responsibility at the center of our lives. The humanistic worldview—as clear-eyed and enlightening as it is kaleidoscopic and richly ambiguous—has inspired people for centuries to make their choices by principles of freethinking, intellectual inquiry, fellow feeling, and optimism.In this sweeping new history, Sarah Bakewell, herself a lifelong humanist, illuminates the very personal, individual, and, well, human matter of humanism and takes readers on a grand intellectual adventure.Voyaging from the literary enthusiasts of the fourteenth century to the secular campaigners of our own time, from Erasmus to Esperanto, from...

> The scathing one now puts forward a different definition altogether. “It’s a philosophy that rejects supernaturalism, regards man as a natural object and asserts the essential dignity and worth of man and his capacity to achieve self-realisation through the use of reason and the scientific method.” ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gws5dsdd4r7rmar1evey3y77))

> Hamza bin Walayat comes from Pakistan, but in 2017 he was living in the UK and applied for permission to remain, on the grounds that his humanist beliefs and his break with Islam had brought threats against his life in his home country, notably from his own family. He feared that, if deported, he could be killed. This was a reasonable fear; humanism is outlawed as blasphemy in Pakistan (as in several other countries) and can even be punished by execution. In practice, Pakistani humanists have been killed mostly by vigilante mobs, with the authorities looking away. A notorious case occurred in that same year, 2017: the student Mashal Khan, who posted on social media as “The Humanist,” was beaten to death by fellow students.

> I take as my guide another great humanist line from E. M. Forster: “Only connect!”
>
> This is the epigraph and recurring refrain of his 1910 novel *Howards End*, and Forster meant a range of things by it. He meant that we should look to the bonds that connect us, rather than to divisions; that we should try to appreciate other people’s angles on the world as well as our own; and that we should avoid the inward splintering of ourselves that is caused by self-deception or hypocrisy. I agree with all of this—and take it as encouragement to tell a story of humanism in a spirit of connection more than division.

> We can start with the first possibility mentioned by the Thurmarshians: understanding human life non-supernaturally. Of all the views that came up in that meeting, this is the one with the oldest recorded pedigree. The first discussion of materialist views (that we know of) arose in India, as part of the Cārvāka school of thought founded by the thinker Bṛhaspati sometime before the sixth century BCE. This school’s followers believed that, when our bodies die, that is the end of us as well. The philosopher Ajita Kesakambalī was quoted as saying:
>
> > This human being is composed of the four great elements, and when one dies the earth part reverts to earth, the water part to water, the fire part to fire, the air part to air, and the faculties pass away into space. . . . Fools and wise, at the breaking-up for the body, are destroyed and perish, they do not exist after death. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gws62rm6c7fe9g5psg1d558t))

> A century or so later, a similar thought turns up in the coastal town of Abdera, in northeastern Greece, home of the philosopher Democritus. He taught that all entities in nature are made up of atoms—indivisible particles that combine in various ways to make all the objects we have ever touched or seen. And *we* are made of these particles, too, both mentally and physically. While we live, they combine together to form our thoughts and sensory experiences. When we die, they drift apart and go to form other things. That is the end of the thoughts and experiences—and therefore we end, too. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gws6309gw3qpqh9yxbw3s3rg))

***

> The atomic theory made Democritus so lighthearted that he was known as “the laughing philosopher”: freed from cosmic dread, he was able to chuckle at human foibles rather than weep over them as others did.
>
> Democritus passed on his ideas to others. Among those to take them up was Epicurus, who founded a community of students and like-minded friends at his school in Athens, known as the “Garden.” Epicureans sought happiness mainly through enjoying their friendships, eating a modest diet of porridge-like gruel, and cultivating mental serenity. A key component of the latter, as Epicurus wrote in a letter, was avoiding “those false ideas about the gods and death which are the chief source of mental disturbances.” ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gws64pwhfcn50rg5ybny8fj4))

***

> The reason we do not know what came next in the book is that nothing beyond those few lines survives—and we have a good idea as to why. The biographer Diogenes Laertius tells us that, as soon as Protagoras’s work on the gods appeared, “the Athenians expelled him; and they burnt his works in the market-place, after sending round a herald to collect them from all who had copies in their possession.” Nothing directly written by Democritus survives, either, or by members of the Cārvāka school, and perhaps it is for similar reasons. From Epicurus we do have a few letters, but his teachings were also turned into verse form by a later Roman, Lucretius, in the long poem *On the Nature of Things*. That was almost lost, too, but a later copy survived in a monastery, where it was found in the fifteenth century by humanistic book collectors and circulated afresh. And so, after all these fragile moments and near losses, Democritan ideas did survive into our own era ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gws68t41zmwh8re6nwqkbn63))

***

> The tradition lives on, too, in the words of a poster campaign of 2009 in the UK, supported by the British Humanist Association (now Humanists UK). The message, displayed on the sides of buses and in other places, was a Democritan statement of mental tranquility: “There’s probably no God. Now stop worrying and enjoy your life.” The idea had come from Ariane Sherine, a young writer and comedian who wanted to provide an alternative, reassuring message after she saw buses carrying an advertisement from an evangelical religious organization whose website threatened sinners with eternal hellfire.

***

> This switching of focus to the here and now remains one of the key principles of modern humanist organizations. It was even formulated as that most unhumanist-sounding thing, a “creed,” or statement of core beliefs. The author of this was Robert G. Ingersoll, a nineteenth-century American freethinker (or non-religious humanist). The creed goes like this:
>
> Happiness is the only good.
>
> The time to be happy is now.
>
> The place to be happy is here.
>
> And Ingersoll ends with the all-important final line:
>
> The way to be happy is to make others so. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gws6b95avr4p45pj8cq8qawf))

***

> This principle of human interconnectivity was put into a neat phrase in a play by Publius Terentius Afer, known as Terence in English. The “Afer” refers to his origin, since he was born, probably as a slave, around 190 BCE in or near Carthage in North Africa; he then found fame in Rome as a writer of comedies. One of his characters says—and I include the Latin because it is still often quoted in the original:
>
> > *Homo sum, humani nihil a me alienum puto.*
>
> Or:
>
> > I am human, and consider nothing human alien to me.
>
> Actually, the line is a comic gag. The character who says it is known for being a nosy neighbor: this is how he replies when someone asks him why he cannot mind his own business. I am sure it got a good laugh, catching the audience off guard and mocking philosophical profundities. It tickles me, too, to think that a quotation cited seriously for so many centuries started life as a piece of knockabout comedy. Yet it does in fact do a good job of summing up an essential humanist belief: that we are all tied up in each other’s lives. We are sociable beings by nature, and we can all recognize something of ourselves in each other’s experiences, even those of people who seem very different from us.

> Christianity also offered both options. Some early Christians were extremely humanistic: for them, praising humans was also a way of praising God, since He made us this way, after all. The fourth-century theologian Nemesius of Emesa sounds a lot like Manetti when he writes, of the human being, “Who could express the advantages of this living thing? He crosses the seas, in contemplation he enters into the heavens, he recognises the motions of the stars . . . he thinks nothing of wild beasts and sea-monsters, he controls every science, craft and procedure, he converses by writing with those with whom he wishes to do so beyond the horizon.” But a few years later, Nemesius’s influential fellow theologian Augustine of Hippo formulated the concept of original sin, which states that we are all born fundamentally *wrong* (thanks to Adam and Eve), and that even newborn babies start out in a flawed condition from which they had better spend their lives seeking redemption.

***

> The purpose of this horrorfest is to shock us awake, so that we understand the need to transform ourselves. It should make us turn away from what Augustine had called the City of Man toward the City of God. What we take to be pleasures and achievements in this world are only vanities. “Do not look for satisfaction on earth, do not hope for anything from humanity,” wrote the mystic and mathematician Blaise Pascal much later. “Your good is only in God.” In lectures of 1901–1902, the philosopher William James analyzed how this two-step move in religion works: first we are made uneasy, feeling “that there is *something wrong about us* as we naturally stand.” Then religion provides the solution: “a sense that *we are saved from the wrongness* by making proper connection with the higher powers.”
>
> It does not occur only in religion, however. Politics can do it, too. In the twentieth century, Fascists began by saying that something was badly wrong with current society, but that it could be fixed if all personal life was subordinated to the interests of the national State. Communist regimes, too, diagnosed errors in the preexisting capitalist system and proposed fixing them with a revolution. The new society might need, for a while, to be shored up by force, but it was worth it because it would lead the population toward an ideological promised land, a state of grace in which no more inequality or suffering would exist. Both systems were officially non-theistic, but only in that they replaced God with something similarly transcendent: the nationalist State, or Marxist theory, plus a cult of personality centered on the leader. They took away ordinary human freedoms and values and offered in return the chance to be raised up into some higher level of meaning or of “true” freedom. Whenever we see leaders or ideologies overruling the conscience, liberty, and reasoning of actual human beings with the promise of something higher, anti-humanism is probably in the ascendant.

> I say this with caution, since humanists are rarely flag wavers by nature anyway. But if they did stitch words on a banner, those words might denote three principles in particular: Freethinking, Inquiry, and Hope. These take different forms, depending on what kind of humanist you are—inquiring will mean one thing to a scholar of the humanities and another to a campaigner for non-religious ethics—but they appear again and again in the many humanist stories we will encounter in the pages to come.
>
> Freethinking: because humanists of many kinds prefer to guide their lives by their own moral conscience, or by evidence, or by their social or political responsibilities to others, rather than by dogmas justified solely by reference to authority.
>
> Inquiry: because humanists believe in study and education, and try to practice critical reasoning, which they apply to sacred texts and to any other sources set up as being beyond question.
>
> And Hope: because humanists feel that, failings notwithstanding, it *is* humanly possible for us to achieve worthwhile things during our brief existence on Earth, whether in literature or art or historical research, or in the furthering of scientific knowledge, or in improving the well-being of ourselves and other living beings.

> If you had a choice, you probably would not want to be born on the Italian peninsula in the early fourteenth century. Life was insecure, with regular hostilities between cities and political groupings. A long-running conflict between the factions known as Guelfs and Ghibellines was resolved, only for the winning Guelfs to split into “White” and “Black” factions and start fighting each other instead. Rome, the historic center of Christendom, was abandoned by a beleaguered pope, Clement V; he fled his enemies and transferred the court to Avignon, an ill-prepared small city beyond the Alps with a terrible climate. The papacy would remain there for decades, leaving a chaotic Rome literally vegetating amid its overgrown ruins. Tuscany was stricken by bad weather and famine—and even worse afflictions were to come.
>
> Yet somehow this anguished part of the world produced a surge of literary energy. Through the 1300s, new generations of writers appeared, filled with the spirit of recovery and revival. They hoped to reach back, past the current troubles, and even past the foundation of Christianity itself, so as to link hands with the writers of the Roman world, whose works had fallen into varying degrees of forgottenness. These new writers looked to an old model of good living, based on friendship, wisdom, virtue, and the cultivation of power and eloquence in language. From these elements, they created their own literature in a range of genres. Their weapon in all of this was the *studia humanitatis*: the human studies. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gws7hqbgm19z0dbf8zc47nb4))

***

> Signs of a revived interest in the human studies had already appeared in earlier decades, notably from the cosmic visionary Dante Alighieri—promoter of the Tuscan language and master of the art of taking literary revenge on his enemies by inventing a vivid Hell and putting them in it. The real beginning of the new beginning, however, came in the generation after his, with two writers who, like him, came from Tuscany: Francesco Petrarca (known as Petrarch in English) and Giovanni Boccaccio. They more or less invented the way of life that would be, for the next two centuries, the humanist one—not that they used this label of themselves. Only later did people regularly use the word *umanisti*; but Petrarch and Boccaccio put together the profile, so it seems reasonable to call them by that name.
>
> To get there, each of them began with a similar step: rebelling against the means of living that their fathers had wanted for them. In Petrarch’s case it was the law; in Boccaccio’s, a choice between mercantile business or the church. Separately, they both chose a new path instead: the literary life. A youthful counterculture can take many forms: in the 1300s, it could mean reading a lot of Cicero and starting a book collection.

> Petrarch’s father was a notary by profession, and this made it natural for his son to train for a career in a similar law-related field. But Petrarch hated his legal education. While supposedly studying hard, in Montpellier and then in Bologna, he put much of his energy into collecting books instead. This was long before printing technology; the only way to get reading matter was to find manuscripts to buy, beg, borrow, or transcribe—all of which he did eagerly ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gws7w6r4zfr80kx1963k563g))

***

> A setback occurred when his father threw his first modest collection into the fire, presumably in the hope that it would help the young man concentrate on law. At the last moment, however, he relented and pulled just two books from the flames. They were Cicero on rhetoric, which might be useful for a legal career anyway, and a volume of Virgil’s poetry, which Petrarch was allowed to keep for recreation. Both authors always remained stars in Petrarch’s sky. They would continue to be revered by later humanists: Virgil with his poetic beauty and reinvention of classical legend, Cicero with his thoughts on morality and politics, and his outstandingly elegant Latin prose. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gws7vyjw8qcxxtmmkjsagayt))

***

> For the moment, Petrarch kept his head down—in both the studious and the discreet sense—but when he was twenty-two and his father died, he gave up law and returned to Avignon to start a totally different way of life: the literary one. He began a pattern that he would follow for all his career: working in the entourages of a series of powerful patrons, in exchange for financial security and often a nice house (or two) to live in. The patrons might be noblemen, or territorial princes, or officials of the church; to prepare for the latter, he took minor orders himself as a churchman. His jobs involved some diplomatic services and secretarial labor, but most important, they meant producing a stream of pleasing, flattering, stimulating, or comforting compositions. The main task was doing what Petrarch loved anyway: reading and writing. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gws7x62s6ht9xry2pn3m3gd0))

***

> And, boy, did he write. He poured out treatises, dialogues, and personal narratives; mini-biographies and triumphal celebrations and Latin poems and consolatory reflections and blistering invectives. To please himself as well as others, he wrote beautiful love poetry in the vernacular, developing and perfecting his own version of the sonnet form (still called the Petrarchan sonnet today). Many of these verses were in honor of an idealized woman whom he called “Laura,” and whom he said he had first seen at a church in Avignon on April 6, 1327—a date he recorded in the precious pages of a Virgil manuscript. His delirious agonizing over how unattainable and elusive she was would inspire generations of poets after him. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gws8g7rrxx3s3vcccqz2p5bf))

***

> In between his obligations to patrons in cities, Petrarch often found himself rewarded for his work with the chance to live in attractive houses in the countryside. These interludes fed his inspiration further, as he spent periods of creative leisure wandering in woods and on riverside paths, socializing with friends, or just cohabiting with his beloved books. During his mid-thirties, he had a house in the village of Vaucluse, by the clear water of the stream of the Sorgue, not far from Avignon. Later retreats included a house in the Euganean Hills near Padua, and before that, a house at Garegnano near Milan, by another river, where he could listen to “multicoloured birds in their branches sing in various modes,” and also do botanical experiments by planting different varieties of laurel bushes in the garden.

***

> It must be said that Petrarch was never a stranger to vanity, and sometimes drifted into pomposity. He always claimed to despise his own fame and to be exhausted by the many admirers who came to his door (or doors). But it is clear that he loved it, really. He grew into the full height of his role—and that was a considerable height, literally as well as metaphorically. A later description by Giannozzo Manetti, based on reports by those who knew him, described Petrarch as being tall and having a “majesty” about him. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gws8hczbq0mz96evk0k8ja22))

***

> Despite this elevated air, he also carried a lifelong psychological mark from his insecure beginning. Alongside the moments of self-satisfaction, he would have others: episodes of depression, or *accidia*, an inability to feel anything at all, even unhappiness. At times, everything seemed unknowable and uncertain to him: in his fifties, he would describe himself in a letter as “granting myself nothing, affirming nothing, doubting all but what I consider a sacrilege to doubt.” ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gws8mqj6j3a6hk3swjkqw35w))

***

> When not thinking of the past, he wove his life and writings deeply into the lives of his contemporaries. He developed a vast circle of interesting friends: educated men, of a literary bent themselves, sometimes rich and powerful. He circulated his works among them—so his writings were read by others besides the patrons to whom they were dedicated. This circle also became Petrarch’s useful network of fellow book finders. Each time his friends went anywhere, he gave them shopping lists. Sending one such list to Giovanni dell’Incisa, the prior of San Marco in Florence, Petrarch asked him to show it to everyone he knew in Tuscany: “Let them roll out the closets and chests of their church people and other men of letters in case something might emerge that might be suitable to soothe or irritate my thirst.” Manuscripts, laboriously copied or precariously lent, made their way around the Italian peninsula on dangerous roads filled with robbers; if loaned, they also had to find their way back. Petrarch himself was often on the move, for his work duties as well as social calls, and wherever he went, he would halt if he saw a monastery in the distance: “Who knows if there is something I want here?” He would go in and ask to rummage. If he found a text of value, he sometimes stayed for days or weeks to make his own copy of it.
>
> Imagine what that was like: having to copy, by hand, every word of every book you add to your collection. Even Petrarch found it exhausting. In a letter, he describes writing out a long Cicero text that a friend had lent him, and going slowly so that he could also try to memorize it as he went. His hand became stiff and sore. But just as he thought he could hardly go on, he came to a passage where Cicero himself mentioned having copied someone’s orations. Petrarch felt chastened: “I blushed as though an embarrassed soldier being chided by a respected commander.” If Cicero could do it, so could he. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gws8rbtqpv38w2ff72kh7ypj))

***

> At other times, Petrarch found comfort rather than exhaustion in the act of writing. It was almost an addiction. “Except when writing, I am always tormented and sluggish,” he admitted. One friend who saw him working over-hard on an epic poem tried what we might call an “intervention.” He asked Petrarch innocently for the key to his cabinet. Once he had it, he grabbed Petrarch’s books and writing materials, threw them inside, turned the key, and left. The next day, Petrarch had a headache from morning to evening, and the day after that he developed a fever. The friend gave him back the key. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gws8rn7egbfsgpernhtb315k))

***

> Often, Petrarch did more than mechanical copying. Besides trying to remember what he read, he also applied his own growing scholarship to each new discovery. He pioneered the art of sensitive editing, using fresh manuscript finds to build up fuller versions of ancient texts that had previously existed only in fragments, doing his best to fit them together correctly. His most important production of this kind was an edition of Livy, a historian of Rome whose huge work survived only in parts. (It is still incomplete, but we have more of it now than in Petrarch’s time.) Having found several new sections in different manuscript forms, he assembled them in a volume together with his copies of other existing parts. The resulting book would belong to a great scholar of the next century, Lorenzo Valla (whom we will meet properly later on); Valla added more notes of his own, improving it further. This was exactly what generations of humanists would continue to love doing—enlarging knowledge, using the evidence to make texts richer and more accurate. It was Petrarch who led the way. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gws8wtgztqefnzhxmd4w888y))

***

> The writers he investigated often provided encouragement for such work, and even direct inspiration for his own writing. A particularly energizing discovery was one of his earliest: that of Cicero’s oration *Pro Archia.* Delivered in Rome in the year 62 BCE, it was a defense of the poet Archias, who as an immigrant was about to be denied citizenship of the city on a technicality. Cicero’s argument was that the “human and literary studies” promoted by Archias contributed such pleasure and moral benefit to Roman society that, technicality or no, he ought to be given his citizenship anyway. Petrarch found the full text of this in a monastery in Liège, while traveling through the area with friends. They all had to wait for several days while he made himself a copy to take away. It was the perfect text for someone who was embarking on a life of literature: it meant that Cicero approved of such a life.

> Another collector with a fine library, also of about eight hundred books, was Niccolò Niccoli. A generation younger than Coluccio, and still a child when Petrarch and Boccaccio died, Niccolò grew up to become the librarian to Cosimo de’ Medici—whose family, having made a fortune by banking and trade, used part of that wealth to support scholars and artists. One of Niccolò’s executive decisions was to dig out the books of Boccaccio from their neglectful storage in Santo Spirito and make them more available. He also left his own books to the Medici collections, on condition that they be accessible to anyone who wanted to see or even borrow them. The Medici books became the foundation of Florence’s two main libraries today, the Biblioteca Medicea Laurenziana and the Biblioteca Nazionale Centrale.
>
> Like Boccaccio, Niccolò was the son of a merchant and had gone through the same life-changing process of rejecting that line of work in favor of a literary and scholarly career. He delighted in both pleasures and treasures, and lived surrounded by his hoard of sculptures, mosaics, and pottery, as well as manuscripts. He did not marry and lived alone except for servants, but in company he was scintillating, according to the memoirs of book dealer Vespasiano da Bisticci, a valuable source on many humanists of the time. “Whenever he joined a discussion of learned men, which he often did for relaxation, his funny stories and mordant raillery (for he naturally overflowed with comic jests) would make all his listeners laugh continuously,” wrote Vespasiano. Giannozzo Manetti wrote a biography, too, and noted how Niccolò “enhanced his natural good looks with fine, plum-colored garments.” He encouraged groups of young scholars to come to his house to read his books, and then to put the books down and discuss whatever they had learned from them.

> While working for the Roman contingent during that time, Poggio and his friends explored monasteries in a large area around Constance. Petrarch would have envied them their finds. At Cluny Abbey, they came upon more Cicero speeches. At St. Gall, they found several works, including a good text of Vitruvius’s treatise on architecture, and something especially desirable: the first complete text of Quintilian’s *Institutes of Oratory*—that bible of rhetorical technique, with its argument that to be an orator one must be a virtuous person. Then, probably in Fulda, Poggio and his friend Bartolomeo da Montepulciano found Lucretius’s *On the Nature of Things*, the long poem transmitting the Epicurean and Democritan theory of atoms and skepticism about the gods. Fragments had been mentioned by other authors, so it was known to exist, but it was assumed to be lost in its full form. Poggio sent it to Niccolò, who was so entranced by it that his usual openness failed him. He kept it to himself for ten years before letting anyone else, even Poggio, spend time with it.

> It was during this time in Rome that Poggio wrote a book of quips and anecdotes, *Facetiae*: a highly humanistic amusement full of double entendres, as in the story of the messenger who asks a woman if she wishes to send a note to her husband, who is away from home. “How can I write,” she replies, “when my husband has taken his pen away with him, and left my inkwell empty?” The book circulated widely and was printed long after Poggio’s death in many editions—the first published joke book.

> In their copying and writing, Coluccio, Niccolò, Poggio, and others developed a new style of handwriting to reflect their new spirit. Known as the “humanistic hand,” it was based on writing that they thought was from antiquity, though in fact it was none other than the minuscule first developed by Charlemagne’s scribes. Simple and easier to read than the usual medieval hand, it was perfect for readers who could set their own pace and get through many books, rather than having to recite texts aloud, with slow care, at a lectern. The humanists dismissed the more elaborate style as “Gothic,” an insult implying “barbarian”—as in the hordes of Goths and Vandals who had brought Rome to its earlier downfall. Their own rival style said everything about how they saw themselves: reviving old simplicity, sweeping away clutter, and ushering knowledge into the light.

> And yet some humanist women did make their mark. An outstanding early example was the first known female professional writer, Christine de Pizan. Born in Venice in 1364, she spent most of her life in France, apparently acquiring from her physician father a reasonable education in Italian and French, and possibly also Latin. She married at fifteen and had three children. The course of her life changed when both her husband and her father died, leaving her with the responsibility of supporting herself, her children, and her mother. To do this, she turned to writing, producing works for the king and others in exchange for financial patronage. Her versatility was impressive: in addition to works on ethics, education, politics, and war—all considered masculine subjects—she wrote love poetry and some verses recounting episodes of her own life, illustrating one of Petrarch’s favorite themes: *The Mutability of Fortune*. In 1405, she wrote *The Book of the City of Ladies*, a collection of stories drawing on a work by Boccaccio about women in myth and history, but adding a rousing defense of women’s general skills and moral excellence. Much of the defense is spoken by the voice of Reason, who, as in the positive half of Petrarch’s *Remedies for Fortune Fair and Foul*, provides cheering thoughts to offset gloom. When the narrator becomes depressed by reading the many misogynistic things men have written about women, Reason cheers her. She suggests asking the question: Have these men never been wrong about anything? Clearly they have, since they so often contradict or correct one another and cannot all have been right. “Let me tell you,” she says, “that those who speak ill of women do more harm to themselves than they do to the women they actually slander.” She advises the narrator to build a “City of Ladies” in her mind and fill it with all the examples she can discover of scholarly, brave, and inspiring women. This is a different sort of rescue task: deploying forgotten figures to cheer the living. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gy7y48raha4hta5pn2ek1j7j))

> To one pupil, Leonello d’Este, Guarino wrote in praise of the pleasures of reading books outdoors, perhaps in a boat on the river. He described gliding, book open on his knees, past vineyards and fields full of singing farmers. But reading in an indoor library could be almost as delightful. A dialogue by another author features a scene of Guarino advising Leonello on how to decorate such a library: besides books, one could add roses, sprigs of rosemary, a sundial, a lyre, and pictures of gods and scholars. Best not to include kittens or caged birds, however; their antics are too distracting. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gya3dend2sqcn2mtkw074s77))

> Imagining this ideal library brings to mind another such setting: the magnificent palace of Urbino, a little farther down the Italian peninsula. The duke there, Federico da Montefeltro, began as one of Vittorino’s pupils in Mantua. He then made his fortune as a *condottiere*, or mercenary soldier, and from 1454 put that fortune into building a dream palace, high on a hill, with perfectly proportioned architecture and an internal decor that sang of the humanities and humanity. In his private study were beautiful images, in colored woods, of admired writers (Homer, Virgil, Cicero, Seneca, Tacitus), and of musical instruments, classical temples, parrots, and his pet squirrel—not too distracting, since in wooden form they couldn’t leap around. His full library filled two halls, adorned with frescoes of the Arts and Sciences and a Latin inscription saying, of his book collection: “In this house you have wealth, golden bowls, abundance of money, crowds of servants, sparkling gems, rich jewels, precious chains and girdles. But here is a treasure that far outshines all these splendours.” The supplier of most of the contents was Vespasiano da Bisticci, who reportedly kept thirty-four copyists permanently busy just making manuscripts for the duke of Urbino. All, of course, were written in the clear humanist hand. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gya3es8zk889fwq3j18cchpc))

> Like most inventions that improve human life, the printing press met with skepticism and resistance. The duke of Urbino wanted nothing to do with such books. A German Benedictine abbot, Johannes Trithemius, wrote *In Praise of Scribes*, arguing that manuscripts were better than printed books and that scribing was too useful a spiritual exercise for monks to give up. Then, in order to reach as wide an audience as possible, he had the book printed. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gya3n0p7s43q3ctkv1xq2w37))

> The abbot also argued that parchment was a more durable substance than paper, and this was true—although knicker-based paper has survived beautifully compared with wood-pulp paperbacks of the 1970s. Nonetheless, for making literary works survive, printing surely beats manuscript-copying, since so many copies can be made and distributed. One just has to think of Boccaccio sending the precious pages of the Homer translation back and forth to Petrarch, or Poggio being unable to get Lucretius back from Niccolò for ten years. True, many printed books have been lost from the world, too, but on the whole, books have a better chance than manuscripts. Early printing is a prime example of technical ingenuity working in harmony with cultural knowledge to produce something of lasting value. As Edward Gibbon wrote, from this group of German mechanical workers came “an art which derides the havock of time and barbarism.” ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gya3p9qab3tt909vj8v2mtyy))

> Showing off its author’s inquiring mind, along with his immersion in classical sources and literary technique, *De Aetna* is also a perfect quiet marriage of printed format to content. It amounts to a demonstration of something remarked upon by the twentieth-century literary historian Ernst Robert Curtius: that the true humanistic temperament “delights simultaneously in the world and in the book.” ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gya3z1ss76hyd3j0prsspwf7))

> Many Greek scholars had moved to Italian cities to teach, including one particular influx following an event that shocked Christians everywhere: the Turkish conquest of Constantinople in 1453. Refugees fled, but often had time to grab their book collections, filled with Greek works on philosophy, mathematics, engineering, and more. All this enhanced Italy’s cultural, intellectual, and technical range and fed the circle around Aldus. He knew Greek himself, printed books in Greek, and hosted meetups with rules stating that anyone accidentally slipping up and forgetting to speak Greek must put a coin into a pot. Each time it filled up, Aldus used the money to throw a party. ([View Highlight](https://read.readwise.io/read/01gya47223qnn18swmfm2gfftd))
