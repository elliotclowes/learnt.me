## Highlights
***

> Although the Spartans called themselves 'equals', Sparta was actually a rigidly hierarchical society, comprising: (1) the citizens (homoioi) who lived in the town of Sparta itself; (2) an intermediate class of subordinate peoples called perioikoi, who lived in the surrounding territory, hence their name which means 'the dwellers around'; (3) their servile labourers called 'helots'. So when we talk about 'Spartans' we might mean the homoioi, but we could also mean the perioikoi, the helots, or even a number of other lesser-known Spartan social classes who crop up in our sources.
>
> Even more confusingly for the modern reader, the people we know as 'Spartans' were not really called Spartans. We call them Spartans because they came from the city of Sparta, which might derive from the Greek verb speirô ('I sow'), making Sparta 'the sown land' (Figures 6 and 7). The Spartans called themselves Spartiates, but outsiders usually called them 'Lacedaemonians'. This name dates back to Bronze Age Linear B tablets which mention 'the Lacedaemonian' (ra-ke-da-mi-ni-jo), and reflects the fact that Sparta was not just a city, but what the Greeks called a polis (often translated 'city-state'), comprising the city of Sparta-five villages (each called an obê), with four (Pitana, Limnae, Mesoa, Cynosoura) clustered around a small acropolis (literally 'high-city') near the bank of the Eurotas river, and the fifth (Amyclae) located around five kilometres to the south-and the surrounding 8,500 km2 of countryside. If that was not confusing enough, the Spartans also called the whole territory they controlled neither Sparta nor Lacedaemon, but "Lakônikê gê' ('Laconian land'). So Spartans often appear in our sources not as Spartans, or Lacedaemonians, but as 'Laconians'.

> Xenophon says that Lycurgus' rules ensured that there was enough food to prevent men from either getting too much or too little to eat, and we are told that the ephors fined a certain Naucleides for kings dined in a special royal mess, with each king having two chosen companions called 'Pythians'. The kings were allowed a double portion of food so that they might entertain guests. Spartan kings could on occasion eat at home, and even entertain guests there, but not always. After leading the Spartans to victory at the Battle of Mantinea in 418 BCE, Agis asked for his meal to be delivered to his home so that he could dine with his wife. But the ephors refused him this special treatment, clearly desiring to keep their victorious king's feet firmly on the ground. The next day Agis retaliated by refusing to make a state sacrifice, and in return the ephors fined him for dereliction of duty.

> Plutarch says new mess members were screened, with the existing members polled by secret ballot. The vote needed to be unanimous, to ensure that Spartiates were all 'happy in each other's company'.
>
> Given the wealth disparity in Sparta it seems likely he that some messes were more exclusive than others, and it may have been quite clear to poorer Spartans that some messes-like some modern social clubs and fraternities-were not for them.

> Xenophon says that Lycurgus' rules ensured that there was enough food to prevent men from either getting too much or too little to eat, and we are told that the ephors fined a certain Naucleides for becoming fat. But the food itself was notoriously bad, so much so that a Spartan saying explained that only those who bathed in the Eurotas River (i.e. native Spartans) could enjoy it. The Spartan dietary staple was barley groats, an unpalatable option for many non-Spartans, more typically consumed by slaves.
>
> There was a daily main course (aiklon), which consisted of unbaked barley burgers-hence the testimony of Heracleides Lembos (second century BCE) that 'no-one bakes among the Spartans, for they do not harvest wheat, but eat barley'-the notorious 'black broth', also known as 'blood soup' (haimata) or 'dipping sauce' (bapha), made from pork cooked in salt and blood, and a meat portion. Older Spartiates preferred the blood soup to the meat, perhaps because it was easier for them to eat as their teeth decayed with age. There was also an 'afters' course (epaiklon).
>
> But this was no dessert course. Indeed, Agesilaus once dismissively 'regifted' sweetmeats to his helots because such extravagances were fitting only for slaves! The epaiklon was actually another meat portion, either wild game from hunting expeditions, or lamb or goat from the messmates' flocks. The names of the donors were called aloud so that their 'prowess and assiduity' would be known by all their co-diners.

> The Spartans were ostensibly abstemious when it came to their drinking habits, with Xenophon observing that Spartan practice afforded little opportunity for the 'drunken uproar, or coarse actions and words' found at typical Greek drinking parties (symposia). Critias (c.460-403 BCE) praised the fact that each Spartiate drank from his own cup (the so-called kôthôn which had a special lip that trapped the dregs and could also be taken on military campaigns) rather than passing around a wide-mouthed cup (Figure 11) while making elaborate toasts as other Greeks did. Xenophon praises the Spartans for outlawing 'compulsory drinking', and notes that Spartans of military age were obliged to be careful not to drink too much because they had to walk home in the dark without the aid of a torch.
>
> According to one later story, when some visiting Chians vomited in the hall of the ephors after overindulging in alcohol, the ephors instituted a vigorous investigation to ensure that no Spartiates were responsible. After determining that it must have been the Chians, the ephors issued a retrospective proclamation, 'the Spartans grant permission to the Chians to be filthy'.
>
> However, Spartan dining might not have been quite as restrained as it seems. Modern scholars have calculated that the mess contributions were so large they would have provided each Spartiate with around 6,429 calories per day, as many calories as modern Olympians in training, even before he touched the afters course. No wonder then that Xenophon tells us that 'the table is never empty' at Sparta. Various explanations for what happened to this obvious surplus of food have been suggested. One possibility is that the state used the extras to cater for those maintained at public expense-that is, the kings, the Pythians, and the ephors. Another option is that Spartiate mess contributions also supplied the boys undergoing the upbringing. Another suggestion is that the surplus was 'recirculated' back to the helots to feed them and their families. This would have not only limited the portion sizes of the Spartiates, it would also have ensured there was a larger helot population to work on their estates. Another under-explored possibility is the Spartans' other meal of the day, the so-called 'midday meal', which is often mistakenly translated as 'breakfast'. This is not said to have been eaten in common, but there is nothing in our sources to suggest that it could not have been made up from the Spartiates' monthly contributions.
>
> The Spartiates' monthly wine contributions were similarly enormous, equivalent to nearly fifty bottles each per month today. This would have produced a truly astonishing amount of wine when one factors in the standard Greek practice of watering down wine.
>
> So if a Spartiate wanted to drink very large quantities only the disapproving eye of his fellow diners would have stopped him. Some clearly did overindulge, for the Spartans even had a special term for drinking stronger wine-'a Scythian cup'-so named because Leonidas' half-brother Cleomenes picked up the habit of drinking neat wine from Scythian ambassadors to Sparta. Even then a drunkard's fellow diners might hide his indiscretions; Plutarch tells us that each night the eldest member of the mess pointed to the doors and reminded his fellow diners, 'not a word goes out through these'.
