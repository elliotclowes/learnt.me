> The other exemplar was Abraham Newland. One of twenty-five children of a Southwark miller and baker, he entered the Bank as a seventeen-year-old in 1748, rising to become chief cashier in 1778, and like Race remaining so until shortly before his death, which in his case was in November 1807. In his position, over the course almost thirty years, he slept every night in the Bank, though after business hours he would sometimes retreat to his semi-rural Highbury cottage to take tea and perhaps play the violin, before returning in the evening to Threadneedle Street. After his death, a journalist would call Newland's 'a life less marked by enterprize than by enduring patience and plodding perseverance', adding that 'the progress of a horse in a mill is but a faint type of such an existence'; but Newland himself, remembered by intimates as a cheerful companion not averse to a glass with friends, would never for a moment have doubted the high serious purpose of his unwearying daily round.
