> Now consider the returns in venture capital.

> Horsley Bridge is an investment company with stakes in venture funds that backed 7,000 startups between 1985 and 2014. A small subset of these deals, accounting for just 5 percent of the total capital deployed, generated fully 60 percent of all the Horsley Bridge returns during this period.171 (To put that in context, in 2018 the top-performing 5 percent of subindustries in the S&P 500 accounted for only 9 percent of the index's total performance.) 18 Other venture investors report even more skewed returns: Y Combinator, which backs fledgling tech startups, calculated in 2012 that three-quarters of its gains came from just 2 of the 280 outfits it had bet on. 19 "The biggest secret in venture capital is that the best investment in a successful fund equals or outperforms the entire rest of the fund," the venture capitalist Peter Thiel has written.201 "Venture capital is not even a home-run business," Bill Gurley of Benchmark Capital once remarked. "It's a grand-slam business."211 What this means is that venture capitalists need to be ambitious. The celebrated hedge-fund stock picker Julian Robertson used to say that he looked for shares that might plausibly double in three years, an outcome he would view as "fabulous."221 But if venture capitalists embarked on the same quest, they would almost guarantee failure, because the power law generates relatively few startups that merely double in value. Most fail completely, in which case the value of their equity rounds to zero-an unthinkable catastrophe for a stock market investor.

> But each year brings a handful of outliers that hit the proverbial grand slam, and the only thing that matters in venture is to own a piece of them. 231 When today's venture capitalists back flying cars or space tourism or artificial intelligence systems that write film scripts, they are following this power-law logic. Their job is to look over the horizon, to reach for high-risk, huge-reward possibilities that most people believe to be unreachable. "We could cure cancer, dementia, and all the diseases of age and metabolic decay," Peter Thiel enthuses, dripping with disdain for incrementalism. "We can invent faster ways to travel from place to place over the surface of the planet; we can even learn how to escape it entirely and settle new frontiers."24l Of course, investing in what is categorically impossible is a waste of resources. But the more common error, the more human one, is to invest too timidly: to back obvious ideas that others can copy and from which, consequently, it will be hard to extract profits.

> What type of experiment is likely to be fruitful? Here, too, people outside innovation hubs can learn something from Khosla. Most of us might assume that experts in each field will advance the frontiers of knowledge. But, as we have seen from Khosla's bet on Patrick Brown, that is much too sensible. Experts may be the most likely source of incremental advances, but radical rethinks tend to come from outsiders. "If I'm building a health-care company, I don't want a health-care CEO," Khosla says. "If I'm building a manufacturing company, I don't want a manufacturing CEO. I want somebody really smart to rethink the assumptions from the ground up." After all, he continues, retail innovation did not come from Walmart; it came from Amazon. Media innovation did not come from Time magazine or CBS; it came from YouTube and Twitter and Facebook. Space innovation did not come from Boeing and Lockheed; it came from Elon Musk's SpaceX. Next-generation cars did not come from GM and Volkswagen; they came from another Musk company, Tesla. "I can't think of a single, major innovation coming from experts in the last thirty, forty years," Khosla exclaims. "Think about it, isn't that stunning?"

> Most financiers allocate scarce capital based on quantitative analysis. Venture capitalists meet people, charm people, and seldom bother with spreadsheets. Most financiers value companies by projecting their cash flows. Venture capitalists frequently back startups before they have cash flows to analyze. Other financiers trade millions of dollars of paper assets in the blink of an eye. Venture capitalists take relatively small stakes in real companies and hold them. Most fundamentally, other financiers extrapolate trends from the past, disregarding the risk of extreme "tail" events. Venture capitalists look for radical departures from the past. Tail events are all they care about.
