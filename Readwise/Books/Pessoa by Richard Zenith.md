## Highlights
***

> This larger failure was both the cause and consequence of saudade, word that signifies intense longing, yearning, nostalgia, both as a tem porary mood or state of mind and as an existential condition. Its mean ing is akin to Sehnsucht, but the German word never served, e of progress. That very disparity at least prodded the nations on its own, as the basis for a collective identity. Saudade, promoted as a uniquely Portuguese feeling, became a national obsession in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. The specific historical object of that obsession was the Age of Discoveries, when Portugal controlled vast tracts of ocean and numerous seaports around the world. Accomplished against great odds, this maritime supremacy might have transformed life in the home country, were half of the resulting wealth not grossly mismanaged and the other half squandered, leaving future generations to pine after glory days that had never existed, except for an exiguous group of profiteers, investors, and aristocrats. Pessoa was born into a world in which ghostly shades of former splendors hovered amid palpable poverty and decay. (Page 6)

Why didn't I die there, in Backa one of those moments, preoccupied with the wiles of my schooln th it mates and the as-if-unexpected arrival of my schoolteachers? Today I can't do this. . . . Today I have only reality, which I can't play with. .. . Poor little boy exiled in his manliness! Why did I of cle late,fi ollectal have to grow up? (Page 89)
