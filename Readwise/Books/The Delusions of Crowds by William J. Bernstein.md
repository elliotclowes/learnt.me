## Highlights
***

> Charles Kindleberger observed, â€œthere is nothing so disturbing to one's well-being and judgment as to see a friend get rich."

***

> Mackay's own behavior demonstrated just how susceptible even the most rational and well-informed observers can be to a financial mania. Shortly after he published Extraordinary Popular Delusions in 1841, England experienced a financial mania that revolved around the great high-tech industry of the time, the railroad, which was even larger than the twin bubbles that swept Paris and London in 1719-1720. Investors, greedy for stocks, underwrote the increase in England's track mileage from two thousand in 1843 to five thousand in 1848, and thousands of more miles were planned but never built when shares finally went bust. If anyone should have foreseen the collapse, it was Mackay.

> The public proves easy pickings for the blandishments of the heroic, charismatic promoters. Competent investing requires a rare combination of mathematical ability, technological expertise, and, most critically, a working knowledge of economic history. Alas, people greatly prefer stories to data and facts; when faced with such a daunting task, humans default into narrative mode, and perhaps the most pleasing story of all is one that involves the effortless wealth to be had from buying into a new technology.
>
> The press falls prey to the promoters in the same way as the public. Few things corrode journalistic excellence as the ease of writing about the revolutionary ventures of brilliant businessmen, who with alarming frequency grace magazine covers, first.as heroes, then as accused felons.

***

> Four characteristic subplots accompany a bubble. First and foremost, financial speculation begins to dominate all but the most mundane social interactions; whenever and wherever people meet, they talk not of the weather, family, or sports, but rather of stocks and real estate. Next, otherwise sensible professionals quit reliable, good-paying jobs to speculate in the aforementioned assets. Further, skepticism is often met with vehemence; while there are always some folks old enough, and with memories long enough, to have seen the play before and to know how it ends, their warnings are met with scorn and ridicule, which over the past several decades has been usually capped with these five words: "You just don't get it." Finally, normally sedate observers begin to make outlandish financial forecasts. Asset prices are predicted to not merely move 10, 20, or 30 percent up or down in a given year, but rather will double, triple, or add a zero.

> The Solar Temple and the Heaven's Gate religious sects are just two examples in a long list of well known modern apocalyptic end-times groups: Jim Jones's Peoples Temple, whose masssuicide/murders in Guyana in 1978 took the lives of 918; the Branch Davidians, whose standoff with clueless federal authorities in Waco, Texas, killed 86 in 1993; and the murderous Japanese Aum Shinrikyo doomsday group, who perpetrated the 1995 Tokyo subway nerve gas attack. What's striking about all these groups is that so many of their members, like Jouret and Vuarnet, were highly educated and accomplished.

> A 2010 Pew Foundation poll found that more than a third of Americans believe that Jesus will return in their lifetime, and most of those believe in the Rapture.1

> A few years ago finance professional Joel Greenblatt performed a clever variation on the Galton experiment with a class of Harlem schoolchildren, to whom he showed a jar that contained 1,776 jelly beans. Once again, the average of their guesses, when submitted in silence on index cards, was remarkably accurate: 1,771 jelly beans.
>
> Greenblatt then had each student verbalize their guesses, which destroyed the accuracy of their aggregate judgment-the new, "open" estimates averaged out to just 850 jelly beans. Thus, the more a group interacts, the more it behaves like a real crowd, and the less accurate its assessments become. Occasionally, crowd interaction becomes so intense that madness results. As put most succinctly by Friedrich Nietzsche, "Madness is rare in the individual-but with groups, parties, peoples, and ages it is the rule." Mackay also recognized this; perhaps the most famous line in Extraordinary Popular Delusions is "Men, it is said, think in herds; it will be seen that they go mad in herds, while they only recover their senses more slowly, and one by one."

> As put by F. Scott Fitzgerald, "The test of a first-rate intelligence is the ability to hold two opposing ideas in mind at the same time and still retain the ability to function."

***

> ... every single one of us is a creature of our societal norms, and occasionally one society's sacrament is another's desecration. Many, if not most, of the world's theologies, for example, tend to view the others belief systems as heretical, even among closely related sects. Especially among closely related sects-Freud's famous "narcissism of small differences." As the old joke goes, a delusion shared by hundreds of people is called a "cult," whereas one shared by millions is called a "religion.'
