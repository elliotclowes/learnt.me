## Highlights
***

> The prehistory of London invites endless speculation and there is a certain pleasure to be derived from the prospect of human settlement in areas where, many thousands of years later, streets would be laid out and houses erected. There is no doubt that the region has been continually occupied for at least fifteen thousand years. A great gathering of flint tools, excavated in Southwark, is assumed to mark the remains of a Mesolithic manufactory; a hunting camp of the same period has been discovered upon Hampstead Heath; a pottery bowl from the Neolithic period was unearthed in Clapham. On these ancient sites have been found pits and post-holes, together with human remains and evidence of feasting. These early people drank a potion similar to mead or beer. Like their London descendants, they left vast quantities of rubbish everywhere. Like them, too, they met for the purposes of worship. For many thousands of years these ancient peoples treated the great river as a divine being to be placated and surrendered to its depths the bodies of their illustrious dead.

> One token of Brutus and his Trojan fleet may still remain. If you walk east down Cannon Street, on the other side from the railway station, you will find an iron grille set within the Bank of China. It protects a niche upon which has been placed a stone roughly two feet in height, bearing a faint groove mark top. This is London Stone. For many centuries it was popularly believed to be the stone of Brutus, brought by him as a deity. 'So long as the stone of Brutus is safe,' ran one city proverb, 'so long shall London flourish.' Certainly the stone is of great antiquity3; the first reference to it was discovered by John Stow in a 'fair written Gospel book' once belonging to Ethelstone, an early tenth-century king of the West Saxons, where certain lands and rents are 'described to lie near unto London stone'. According to the Victorian County History it originally marked the very centre of the old city, but in 1742 was taken from the middle of Cannon Street and placed within the fabric of St Swithin's Church opposite. There it remained until the Second World War; although a German bomb entirely destroyed the church in 1941, London Stone remained intact. It is constructed of oolite which, upon its as a perishable stone, cannot be assumed to have survived since prehistoric times. Yet it has been granted a charmed life.

> It sits now, blackened and disregarded, by the side of a busy thoroughfare; over and around it have flowed wooden carts, carriages, sedan chairs, hansom cabs, cabriolets, hackney cabs, omnibuses, bicycles, trams and cars. It was once London's guardian spirit, and perhaps it is still.

> There were public baths, and temples, and shops, and stalls; there was an amphitheatre where the Guildhall now rests, and just south of St Paul's a racing arena: by the strange alchemy of the city a name, Knightrider Street, has survived for almost two thousand years.

> During the strongest period of its growth, at the end of the first century, the city would have possessed some thirty thousand inhabitants. There were soldiers, and merchants, and businessmen, artisans and artists, Celts and Romans, all mingled together.
