> All this brings us to the final feature of winning teams: the fostering of a culture of sharing. My Wharton colleague Adam Grant categorizes people as "givers," "matchers," and "takers." Givers are those who contribute more to others than they receive in return; matchers give as much as they get; takers give less than they take.
> Cynics might say that giver is a polite word for chump. After all, anyone inclined to freeload will happily take what they give and return nothing, leaving the giver worse off than if he weren't so generous.
> But Grant's research shows that the pro-social example of the giver can improve the behavior of others, which helps everyone, including the giver-which explains why Grant has found that givers tend to come out on top (Page 208)

> One involves the provocative phrase "diversity trumps ability," coined by my colleague (and former competitor in the IARPA tournament) Scott Page." As we have seen, the aggregation of different perspectives is a potent way to improve judgment, but the key word is different. Combining uniform perspectives only produces more of the same, while slight variation will produce slight improvement. It is the diversity of the perspectives that makes the magic work. Superteams were fairly diverse-because superforecasters are fairly diverse-but we didn't design them with that in mind. We put ability first. (Page 209)

> "In war, everything is uncertain," wrote Helmuth von Moltke.¹ In the late nineteenth century, Moltke was famous the world over after he led Prussian forces to victory against Denmark in 1864, Austria in 1866, and France in 1871-victories that culminated in the unification of Germany. His writings on war-which were themselves influenced by the great theorist Carl von Clausewitz-profoundly shaped the German military that fought the two world wars. But Moltke was no Napoleon. He never saw himself directing his army organization was entirely different.
> visionary leader as a like chess pieces. His approach to leadership and The Prussian military had long appreciated uncertainty-they had invented board games with dice to introduce the element of chance missing from games like chess-but "everything is uncertain" was for Moltke an axiom whose implications needed to be teased out. The most urgent is to never entirely trust your plan. "No plan of operations extends with certainty beyond the first encounter with the enemy's main strength," he wrote. That statement was refined and repeated over the decades and today soldiers know it as "no plan survives contact with the enemy." That's much snappier.
> But notice that Moltke's original was more nuanced, which is typical of his thinking. "It is impossible to lay down binding rules" that apply in all circumstances, he wrote. In war, "two cases never will be exactly the same." Improvisation is essential.² Moltke trusted that his officers were up to the task. In addition to their military training, they received what we today would consider a liberal arts education with an emphasis on critical thinking. Even when the curriculum focused on purely military matters, students were expected to think hard. In other nations of that era-including the United States-instructors laid out problems, told students the right answer, and expected them to nod and memorize. In Germany's war academies, scenarios were laid out and students were invited to suggest solutions and discuss them collectively. Disagreement was not only permitted, it was expected, and even the instructor's views could be challenged because he "understood himself to be a comrade among others," noted the historian Jörg Muth. Even the views of generals were subject to scrutiny. "German junior officers were regularly asked for their opinions and they would criticize the outcome of a large maneuver with several divisions before the attending general The Leader's Dilemma 215 The acceptance of criticism went beyond the classroom, and under extraordinary circumstances more than criticism was tolerated. In 1758, when Prussia's King Frederick the Great battled Russian forces at Zorndorf, he sent a messenger to the youngest Prussian general, Friedrich Wilhelm von Seydlitz, who commanded a cavalry unit. "Attack," the messenger said. Seydlitz refused. He felt the time wasn't right and his forces would be wasted. The messenger left but later returned. Again he told Seydlitz the king wanted him to attack.
> Again Seydlitz refused. A third time the messenger returned and he warned Seydlitz that if he didn't attack immediately, the king would have his head. "Tell the King that after the battle my head is at his disposal," Seydlitz responded, "but meanwhile I will make use of it."
> Finally, when Seydlitz judged the time right, he attacked and turned the battle in Prussia's favor. Frederick the Great congratulated his general and let him keep his head. This story, and others like it, notes Muth, "were collective cultural knowledge within the Prussian ofcorps, recounted and retold countless times in an abundance of variations during official lectures, in the officer's mess, or in the correspondence between comrades." The fundamental message: think.
> If necessary, discuss your orders. Even criticize them. And if you absolutely must-and you better have a good reason-disobey them.* All this may sound like a recipe for a fractious organization that get anything done, but that danger was avoided by balancing those elements that promoted independent thinking against those ficer can't that demanded action.

> How the Kennedy White House changed its decision-making culture for the better is a must-read for students of management and public policy because it captures the dual-edged nature of working in groups. Teams can cause terrible mistakes. They can also sharpen judgment and accomplish together what cannot be done alone. Managers tend to focus on the negative or the positive but they need to see both. As mentioned earlier, the term "wisdom of crowds" comes from James Surowiecki's 2004 bestseller of the same name, but Surowiecki's title was itself a play on the title of a classic 1841 book, Extraordinary Popular Delusions and the Madness of Crowds, which chronicled a litany of collective folly. Groups can be wise, or mad, or both. What makes the difference isn't just who is in the group, nedy's circle of advisers demonstrated. The group is its own animal.
