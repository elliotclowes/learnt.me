> The machinery of state relied upon (and to a large degree existed to serve) a professional standing army which numbered around a quarter of a million men at the end of Augustus' reign, and at its peak in the early third century AD COuld field 450,00o troops across the empire. Legions, each containing 5,000 heavy infantry recruited from the Roman citizenry, were augmented by auxiliary units (auxilia) drawn from the empire's vast non-citizen population and mercenaries (numeri)

> recruited from barbarian forces outside the empire's borders. (As we shall see, the barbarian contingent of the Roman army came to dominate in the later years of empire.) Naval fleets employed another 50,000 men. The cost of maintaining this force, dispersed across millions of square miles from the North Sea to the Caspian Sea, gobbled between 2 per cent and 4 per cent of the empire's entire GDP every year; well over half the state budget was spent on defence." (By way of comparison: at the time of writing the USA has by some distance the world's biggest defence and security budget, and as a share of GDP, American military spending is well in line with the Roman Empire's: around 3.1 per cent. However, while this is a lot of dollars spent on drones, tanks and troops, 3.1 per cent of American GDP amounts to roughly 15 per cent of the annual federal budget. In other words, Rome's emperors spent three or four times as much of their available income on the military as recent American presidents. In terms of relative deployment capability and escalation potential - the ability, if you like, to bring a rocket launcher to a fist-fight- the modern USA occupies a similar position in the world as the first century AD Roman Empire. It's usually best not to mess with them.) (Page 17)

> The typical Roman soldier signed on to serve for at least ten years prior to the third century AD the prize for serving in the auxiliaries for twenty-five years was full Roman citizenship. Regular pay was reasonable, while the roles available were many and varied. Besides infantry, trained to fight with a short sword, long, curved shield and javelin, the Roman army employed horsemen, artillerymen, medics, musicians, clerks and engineers. There was a strong culture of reward and honour for distinguished service, but by the same token, discipline was brutally strict, proceeding by starvation, flogging and on occasion summary execution. According to the Greek writer Polybius, who composed a detailed history of Rome in the second century BC, soldiers who failed to stand their ground in battle could be punished by fustuarium supplicum, in which their colleagues jointly cudgeled or stoned them to death." In the case of mass failure or disobedience, a legion might be decimated (decimatio): one soldier in ten would be selected by lot and beaten to death by his colleagues. (Page 18)

> Yet greatness did not arrive until relatively late in Muhammad's life. He was working as a merchant when, at around the age of forty (in c. AD 609/10), he began to experience dreams, visions and visitations from celestial beings. The turning point came while he was in a cave in Mount Hira, on the outskirts of Mecca, a place he liked to go now and then to meditate and reflect. One day he was visited there by the angel Gabriel, who addressed him directly and commanded him to recite. Muhammad came to understand he had been chosen as Allah's Prophet and messenger - the last such in a long line that stretched back through Jesus, Solomon, David, Abraham, Noah and Moses all the way to the first man, Adam. This was big news, but he overcame his initial terror and confusion. His next visitation took three years to arrive, but when it did, Muhammad began to receive the word of God regularly, sometimes in spoken form and sometimes as a ringing sound which had to be deciphered. The angel showed him ritual ablutions and the best way to pray to Allah. These were the basic rites of a new religion: Islam. Muhammad's revelations, as he recited them in Arabic, were eventually collected as the Qur'an. Later on, fragments of the Prophet's speech, along with oral memories of his opinions and actions, known as Hadith, were compiled as the Sunnah – which contributed to the formation of an Islamic legal code and moral framework.

> Yet Umar was not successful simply because he was charismatic and capable. He was also the chief executive officer and spiritual leader of a machine built for and fed by conquest, and perfectly attuned to its day. When the Muslims were expanding and consolidating their rule in Arabia under Muhammad and Abu Bakr, conversion to Islam was a prerequisite of conquest. But once they ventured outside the Arabic-speaking world, the Muslims did not attempt simply to repeat this model. Whether they swept through regions populated by desert nomads or drew up their horsemen and siege catapults outside the great cities of Byzantine and Persia, they made it clear that they did not come as a dogmatic army hell-bent on converting or killing every man, woman and child before them. Their only demand was that communities surrendered quickly and submitted to government by a Muslim ruling elite. Christians, Jews and other monotheists were not expected to become Muslims - and in some cases actively discouraged from doing so on the grounds that they would contribute higher tax yields as infidels than they would as believers. They were exempted from military service and obliged only to pay the jizyah poll tax and rule their own communities in an orderly and civilized fashion. Meanwhile, the Muslim soldiers who formed the conquering armies were largely kept separate Trom the populace, garrisoned in military towns and paid a stipend known as the ata, funded by taxation. They were not, however, rewarded with tracts of land nor confiscated estates: a policy that helped reduce civil tension in the short term, and in the long run meant that the Muslim armies did not blend over a couple of generations into the local population, in the Roman essence, the package offered by the generals of the Roman Republic without resistance was of course not original: it had been in, pursuing military expansion without provoking long insurgencies.

Pragmatic acceptance of local practices at least in the short term - has always been an effective way of 22 of Yet in the seventh century the offer of religious tolerance may haye had particular appeal. Given the poisonous sectarian violence that had swirled around the Christian world in Byzantium, the arrival of a new ruling power that cared little for the tortuous debates over reconciling Christ's spiritual and human natures - one which taxed unbelievers, rather than persecuting them – may have come as blessed relief.

> This is not to say, however, that the Arab Conquests were wholly heartfelt and peaceful. Cities and tribes that resisted the Muslim armies forfeited their right to be welcomed into the fold in an orderly fashion. During the wars in Arabia, Muhammad had approved the beheading of hundreds of male members of the Jewish Banu Qurayza tribe, and the enslavement of all their women and children.3 The many battles fought between the Muslims and their various imperial opponents were also bloody affairs, and the accounts of these, too, overspill with tales of thousands, tens of thousands – even (improbably) hundreds of thousands of warriors slain at a time. After one battle in Persia, reported al-Tabari, 'the youngsters of the [Muslim] army went to inspect the dead... they gave water to the Muslims in whom there was a breath of life and killed the polytheists in whom there was a breath of life...

Although there were many examples of Muhammad preaching tolerance and peace, the Hadith compiled during Umar's caliphate also contained striking pronouncements advocating for war and violence. In Muhammad was reported to have said: 'Allah guarantees that He will admit the Mujahid [holy warrior] in His Cause into Paradise if he is killed, otherwise He will return him to his home safely with rewards and war booty.5 The concept of jihad (meaning struggle)

> It was an epic, furious encounter. The Byzantine empire may only have been a shadow of the once-unassailable Roman state, but in the 670s they had a secret weapon. Military technicians working for the emperor Constantine IV (r. 654–85), led by a scientist from southern Syria known as Kallinikos, had perfected a deadly, oilbased jelly, known variously as Roman Fire, marine fire, artificial fire or (most famously) Greek Fire.34 When this incendiary liquid was sprayed under pressure, flame-thrower style, from jets mounted on the prows of specially equipped Byzantine fireships, it turned everything it clung to into an oily fireball, Greek Fire burned in the air, it burned on water, it could only be put out by smothering it with sand or diluting it with vinegar, and it could obliterate whole fleets during the course of a single engagement. Greek Fire was a game-changing weapons system, and a military secret the Byzantine state would guard closely for nearly five hundred years, so closely indeed that the knowledge of how to manufacture and deploy it was ultimately forgotten. In the meantime, however, it became notorious as one of foulest horrors of medieval battle.

Its testing ground was the war against the Umayyads. In 678 the emperor turned Greek Fire on Muslim ships, and sent them away from the sea-defences of Constantinople with their masts smoking and sails blazing. As they scattered, they were smashed by powerful storms off the coast of Asia Minor. Up to thirty thousand men drowned. The fleet was dashed to pieces and perished entirely, wrote Theophanes." It was a triumph for Byzantium, a pivotal point in the history of warfare, and a round humiliation for the Muslims. (Page 146)

> Charlemagne was described by the chronicler Einhard as being large and strong; when his grave was exhumed in the nineteenth century he was measured at a little over 6'3" – a prodigious height for his times. "The top of his head was round, his eyes large and lively, his nose was a little larger than average, he had fine white hair and a cheerful and attractive face, Einhard wrote. He was CC a strong swimmer and liked keeping clean, doing much of his business while in the bath. When clothed he tended to wear 'a linen shirt and linen underwear, a tunic fringed with silk and stockings... and he covered his shoulders and chest in winter with a jacket made of otter-skin or ermine and a blue cloak, and he was always armed with his sword, which had a gold or silver hilt and belt? Only on feast days or visits to see the pope in Rome would he wear gold robes or jewels; 'on other days his costume was little different from that of the common people? He was ostentatiously pious, a keen reader who could also write to a basic standard, a light sleeper and a healthy eater, although never a drunk. He was, then, in Einhard's sympathetic eyes at least, the very image of a mighty king. (Page 179)
