- 06:10: Awake. Woken up to a cloudy, rainy morning. And I’m surprised by how much I don’t like it. Traditionally there’s nothing better for me than a rainy day. Especially on a weekend when I’m not working. I love it. But for the past week I’ve woken up to cold but sunny mornings. And because I’m doing my morning walks I much prefer that kind of weather. Oh well, it being a Saturday I’m not going for my walk first thing and am going in a few hours instead. So hopefully the weather will have improved by then.
