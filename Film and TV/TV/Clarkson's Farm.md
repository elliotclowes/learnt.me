### Season 3

I watched the first season and thought it was good enough. But I didn’t finish the second. However I kept on hearing such good things about season three (mostly from my sister [[Natalie]]) that I had to check it out. And I was glad I did. It was a nice, easy watch. Not too easy in that I would use it only as background, but not too challenging that I needed my brain. It was in the sweet spot. Very enjoyable. And I’m sure I’ll rewatch it again. [[2024-06-13]]
