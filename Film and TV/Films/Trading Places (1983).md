I’d never seen [_Trading Places_](https://www.justwatch.com/uk/movie/trading-places) before and I was suprised by how much I liked it. I wanted a an inbetween [[Christmas]] film to watch evening. It’s still a bit too early in the December to be watching ‘proper’ Christmas film, so I went with this as I’d heard it’s kind of a Christmas film. Also I rewatched [_Planes, Trains and Automobiles (1987)_](https://www.justwatch.com/uk/movie/planes-trains-and-automobiles) the other day so I thought I’d stay on the 80’s theme

A lot of the [[1980]]’s classic American films aren’t actually for me though. But this was delightful. I would consider this a perfect Sunday afternoon watch with the family.

Well, if you’re okay with some boobs. One of the things I didn’t like with the film was how Jamie Lee Curtis’s character jumps straight into bed with Dan Aykroyd (**literally!**). I know she’s a prostitute, but blimey. But yes there’s also a really random, gratuitous shot of Curtis topless which felt in poor taste.

Overall this is a charming film. **7.5/10**
