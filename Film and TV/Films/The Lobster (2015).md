Imagine a world where being single isn't just frowned upon â€“ it's outlawed. That's the premise of The Lobster. In this dystopian society adults have 45 days to find a romantic partner. Fail, and you're transformed into an animal of your choice.

It's an odd premise and an odd film. When I saw it in the cinema first time around, I loved it. I hadn't seen [[Yorgos Lanthimos]]' work before, so I was surprised and delighted by its weirdness, and he's now one of my favourite directors. Its genuinely funny in its absurdity and I love it. It could perhaps have 15 minutes cut from it and its ending isn't quite strong enough. But this an odd and wonderful film. You'll probably either love it or hate it.
