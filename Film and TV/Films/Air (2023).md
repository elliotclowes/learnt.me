"Air" is about the creation of Air Jordan shoes at Nike. It's silly and corny, but very enjoyable.

Moving along at a quick, fun pace and feels a bit like an [Adam McKay](https://letterboxd.com/director/adam-mckay/) film at times.

This is also quite the 'Dad film' (another one for [[Matt Damon]], after [Ford v Ferrari](https://www.justwatch.com/uk/movie/ford-v-ferrari)).

You might have missed "Air". But you should correct that, as it's a great way to spend 111 minutes and very much worth a watch. It's hard to dislike it.

Also: are you ever unsatisfied by the "where are they now" segment at the end of a "based on a true story" film, when they don't go into enough detail? Well this delivers in this department.

After "Air" you should watch:
- [The Last Dance](https://www.justwatch.com/uk/tv-series/the-last-dance), a documentary about [[Michael Jordan]].
- [BlackBerry](https://www.justwatch.com/uk/movie/blackberry), another 'business film'. It's another solid film you might have missed.
