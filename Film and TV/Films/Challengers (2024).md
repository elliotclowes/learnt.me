## Review ([[2024-02-22]])

I did something I can so rarely do when I watch films, but that I always aspire to do. And that’s know almost nothing about it. I hadn’t seen the trailer, I didn’t know who the director was, and didn’t even know the plot. All I knew was that it was about [[tennis]] and that [[Zendaya]] and Prince Charles from The Crown was starring in it.

And I thoroughly enjoyed this. I just sat back and went along for the ride. This is about sex and competition and rivalry and sexuality.

I only have one or two minor complaints. It could have been 15 minutes shorter firstly. And also that there was a slight lack of chemistry and dirtiness amongst the cast. This is about sex. But the three main characters almost gave a prime, proper, sexless vibe at times. Not all the time. One scene in particular did it well. But the rest of the scenes sometimes lacked a sexual charge running through them.

Still, I’m quibbling. This is really good. I didn’t realise until the end that the soundtrack was by [[Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross]] (who I love). And the soundtrack really gives this film a great energy. It makes you realise early on that this isn’t just another tennis film.

There’s also some innovative camera work in this film too.
