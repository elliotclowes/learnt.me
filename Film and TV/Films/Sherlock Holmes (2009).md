Who knew a [[Guy Ritchie]] [[Sherlock Holmes]] would be so great. I remember very clearly seeing this in the cinema in [[2009]] and being enthralled by the funness of it. And that funness was enhanced by it being period Holmes, not modern.

This is one of the films that I [[Yearly Watches|try to watch yearly]].
