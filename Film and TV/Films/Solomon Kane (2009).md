I saw this upon release at the cinema and found it bad and dull. But on second viewing I weirdly enjoyed it. I knew it wasn't great, so I could just sit back and enjoy the [[medieval]] sword and sorcery vibe. And I now have a real soft spot for this film.

If you like the idea of seeing a badass crusader-turned-monk fight witches, countryside criminals and his past, then you might enjoy this.

Sure, some of the acting is suspect at times. And it's clearly not a super high budget affair. But despite that it's well put together, with the costumes, set design and cinematography all looking good.
