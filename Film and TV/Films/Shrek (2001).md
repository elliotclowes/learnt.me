I don't tend to love Disney, DreamWorks and Pixar. I recognise that they're often good, but I just don't connect with them. Shrek is an exception.

It is a perfect 90 minute film that any age will enjoy. Full of heart or jokes it doesn't age and is very rewatchable. If I'm feeling sick or down in the dumps it's always something I'm drawn to.
