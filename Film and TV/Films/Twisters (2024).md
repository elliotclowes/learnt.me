I was excited to sit back with my popcorn and enjoy this. But I was disappointed. This is actually a well put together blockbuster. There's plenty of twisters, I'm happy to see Daisy Edgar-Jones in a big production and I liked Glen Powell. There's not a lot to hate. But for whatever reason this never grabbed my attention and I found it boring. **42%**
