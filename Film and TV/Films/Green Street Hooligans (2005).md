I watched this straight after [[Road House (2024)]] and it made for a good “dumb but fun” double bill.

I have to say I do have a tiny soft spot for this film. I wouldn’t call it a staple of my teenage years, but I certainly watched it a few times. My teenage self rather liked it. And my adult self rather likes it too, it turns out.

Don’t get me wrong, it’s not _good_. Charlie Hunnam is terrible – as he is in all films. And it does a good job of glorifying violence and football hooliganism. But if you take it as it is, it delivers. The glorified violence is well done and it is genuinely scary at time. And it’s just hilarious watching it knowing this was the first film Elijah Wood did after [[The Lord of the Rings]]. Such an odd, but original, choice by him. You’ve got to respect it.
