## Reviews

### [[2024-09-14]]

It's always tough for me to review horror films, as I watch so few and it's not a genre I generally like. So I tend to rate even the best horror films lower than the average person might.

I watched this as AI recommended it as a 'cosy' horror film. It's mildly cosy I suppose, but not massively.

But what about the film itself? It was okay. Nicole Kidman has a good 'horror face', with her large eyes and gaunt face. And the two kids in it did well, especially the boy. And overall there's enough mystery and tension throughout to keep you going. And the running time is perfect. I never really got bored, which happens often with horror for me, as the pace is often slow. And I'd also recommend this to someone who wants a horror film that isn't too scary. 20+ years on this is quite a quaint piece of horror. It's not nasty or reliant on jump scares. **52%**
