### Live at Usher Hall - 2023-12-07

My girlfriend knew I liked the film so when in [[Edinburgh, Scotland 1]] she surprised me by booking a screening of it with a live orchestra doing the music.

I'd never seen it with an audience before. It enhanced the experience actually, hearing peoples laughter.

However, Usher Hall's seats were awful. My knees were literally going into the backs of the people in front. One of the [[Things I Know About Myself]] is that I hate going to any theatre of concert hall with seating. They're always uncomfortable. And these were some of the worst.
