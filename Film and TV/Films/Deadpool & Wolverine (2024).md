In a case of [[déjà vu]] my second viewing of this mirrored my first:
- [[Nando's]] before.
- Fell asleep in the same parts.

This was about the same second time around. Considering I only watched it a week prior and am not a huge Deadpool or Wolverine fan I thought it was still solid. The crassness got to me a bit more on second viewing though. **64%**

I had eaten a large [[Nando's]] before the trip to the cinema, so I struggled to stay away for some of this. But this was good. There was too much fighting and blowjob jokes for me. But it is incessantly funny. Not all jokes land, but more than enough. I didn't understand the villains motives or plans half the time, but that's fine.

If you're a fan of Deadpool and want to see Wolverine cut loose then you'll love this. If you're not then you'll likely strong dislike it. **64%**
