Adequately put together and fairly fun, but this was just okay. 

The whole Wall Street vs. the working person story felt forced at times and it didn’t lead to a satisfying conclusion in the final act.

The ‘dumb’ bad guys were comically dumb. And the ‘scary’ bad guys weren’t scary enough.

However, the reviews for this are strong and my girlfriend really enjoyed it, so I’m in a minority. 

And this _was_ weirdly watchable and fun. And I always enjoy seeing Paul Dano on screen. He always brings the human to his roles, and this one is no different. **59%**
