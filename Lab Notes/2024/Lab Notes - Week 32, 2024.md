#### MRI vs fMRI

[[MRI]] focuses on anatomical details, while [[fMRI]] focuses on brain activity and function.

GPT-4o:

> MRI and fMRI machines are both used for imaging but serve different purposes. MRI, or Magnetic Resonance Imaging, provides detailed images of the structures within the body, such as organs, tissues, and bones. It uses strong magnetic fields and radio waves to generate images and is commonly used for diagnosing conditions like tumours, joint abnormalities, and brain structure issues. On the other hand, fMRI, or Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging, measures and maps brain activity by detecting changes associated with blood flow. It detects changes in blood oxygenation and flow that occur in response to neural activity, as more active brain areas consume more oxygen and have increased blood flow. fMRI is often used in research to study brain functions and in clinical settings to plan surgeries or understand neurological conditions. In summary, MRI focuses on anatomical details, while fMRI focuses on brain activity and function.
