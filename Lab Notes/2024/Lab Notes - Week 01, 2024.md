### PIM

I've always had a keen interest in managing my own digital and physical information. Well apparently there's a term for that: [[Personal Information Management]] (PIM). Here's the [Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_information_management), which is long and detailed – unsurprisingly.

I discovered the concept of PIM via [this reddit comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/datacurator/comments/18euq2e/how_to_combine_daily_journal_with_general/kcqxcjj/) on /r/datacurator which linked to a [post on it](https://karl-voit.at/tags/pim/)[°](https://elliotclowes.com/cold/2024/https__karl-voit.at_tags_pim_.html) on the blog of Karl Voit. I love finding a new, good personal blog! It happens too rarely these days.

And via his post [How to Choose a Tool](https://karl-voit.at/2021/01/18/tool-choices/) I discovered that there's an actual name for the quote: "I suppose it is tempting, if the only tool you have is a hammer, to treat everything as if it were a nail." It's called [[Law of the instrument]] by [[Abraham Kaplan]].

### Old Town Clothing

Just discovered – [via the shop Labour & Wait](https://www.labourandwait.co.uk/collections/latest-additions/products/utility-trousers-black) – a really cool clothing company called [Old Town](https://www.old-town.co.uk/collections/product). They make simple, but great looking garments (I'm using the words "garments" very much on purpose). There's a slight hobbit and French quality to them. They're also interesting in that they won't let you buy online. Instead they insist you [visit them for a fitting first](https://www.old-town.co.uk/pages/ordering). As far as I can tell they no longer have stores. So you have to go to Norwich to visit them (as a first time customer anyway). Bit annoying.
