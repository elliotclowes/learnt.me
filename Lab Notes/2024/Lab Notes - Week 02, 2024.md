### Folder lock-in

I've been reading about [[Johnny.Decimal]] and have been considering overhauling how and where I store my files. The only issue is that a lot of my files are being automatically moved via [Hazel](https://www.noodlesoft.com/). I have created lots of rules for auto-moving and backing things up and there's a lot of moving parts. Changing how my folders are organised would likely break most of those Hazel rules. So I'd need to update them. It wouldn't be *too* much of a pain. But it would be a pain nonetheless. I think I'll stick with my current system for now.

The main issue is that I have three main places where things are stored: `Backups`, `Files` and `Documents`. And a common issue is that when I need to check/save something in a sub-folder I can't remember in which of those three folders it lives.

On paper it should work like this:
- `Backups` - Backups of things like websites, software files, config files, bookmarks, etc.
- `Documents` - Nearly all PDF and Word files.
- `Files` - Assorted things that aren't documents. The contents of its sub-folders are 'active' and are often changing.

But in reality it doesn't always work like this. And I am getting too much cognitive load from having to think where something lives. There's certainly room for improvement.
