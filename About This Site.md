## How to use this site

The best way to use to use *Learnt.me* is probably just to to poke around and explore.

There's also a search box at the top left. It will only search for specific notes or headings within notes. If you want to search for specific text *within* my notes you need to put the search within double quotes. So if you want to see if I've ever mentioned the song Southern Man by [[Neil Young]] you just have to put this in the search box: `"Southern Man"`

## How this site works

This website is essentially just a collection of plain text notes that I have written in a piece of software called [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/). Obsidian has an add-on service which turns your notes into a website. That's how *Learnt.me* is made.

### Backlinks

One of the big features of Obsidian is backlinks. This means that when I write about [[Virginia Woolf]] in my notes for the book [["English Food - A Peopleâ€™s History" by Diane Purkiss]] a two-way link is automatically registered. So when you go to the bottom of the page for [[Virginia Woolf]] you can see all the other pages where she is mentioned under the 'Links To This Page' section (see screenshot below). These backlinks help when it comes to exploring. As you can see other pages where something is mentioned.

Backlinks also help you get a sense of how things are connected. As you can see below Virginia Woolf is currently only mentioned once on *Learnt.me*, in a book.

But if you go to the books page you can see a load of different links.

### Internal vs external links

An internal link is just underlined [[Welcome|like this]]. Whereas an external link has an arrow next to it [like this](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virginia_Woolf).

This should help make it easier to browse the site. As a lot of the 'experience' of *Learnt.me* is around clicking on internal pages and staying within the site. So it's good to know if a link will be taking you elsewhere.

### Hover previews

If you just want to have a quick peak or preview of an internal page before clicking it you can just hover over the link and a little popup should appear with the page. [[Welcome|Hover your mouse here]] to see an example of the popup preview.
