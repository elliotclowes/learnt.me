This was a bit of a mess in many ways. Pacing and story was a bit all over the place. Emily Blunt and Ryan Gosling had no chemistry. And Aaron Taylor-Johnson just didn’t work. And like most films it’s 10-20 minutes too long.

However, this is still quite a lot of fun. Some of the gags and jokes fall flat, but many land well and this is a good film if you just want to turn your brain off and watch Ryan Gosling flex his comedic chops – something I’ve always wanted to see more of ever since I saw The Nice Guys. In some ways the charm of this film comes from how chaotic it feels it might have been behind the scenes. Too many comedies feel over written. I don’t know how strong the script was for The Fall Guy but it sometimes felt like they found this film as they went along. And that did lead to some awkward scene but it also lead to some hilarious ones too. Some of my favourite gags were around alien costumes and it’s voice box.
