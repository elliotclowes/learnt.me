## Review

- Founded in [[1893]], this was one of the most famous restaurants in the world in the [[1900s]].
- I visited in May, [[2023]] on a visit to [[Paris, France]].
- It's in a lovely central location.
- I adored the [[art nouveau]] interior. It's dark and stunning.
- I was there at 20:00 on a Wednesday and it was dead inside. It was just me and my girlfriend, and a woman dining alone. There was a few more occupied tables when we left around 21:00, but it was still very quiet. There was some soft music playing, but aside from that it was deathly noiseless. To the point that it was awkward. It was so quiet in fact that the larger part of the restaurant that had a dance floor and stage was closed. Which was a bit of a shame as I wanted to have a look at it.
- Note: I'm writing this some months after I visited, so I may have forgotten some of the details.
- It's a pretty small menu.
- I ordered the cheapest bottle of red wine I could. But it was still pretty damn pricey.
- I had the fillet [[steak]] at â‚¬61, which was decent enough. The mashed potato was as you'd expect from the French, buttery and delicious.
- For dessert I had the profiteroles, which was tasty, rich and large enough that I didn't finish it.
- **Overview:** this is an iconic restaurant with a gorgeous interior. But it was lifeless inside and so incredibly quiet. The staff and other patrons were all elderly and there was zero energy around. It's a very pricey place and that food isn't good enough to support those prices. This is one of those places you visit once to experience a bit of 'old Paris' and that's about it. I visited on the same night I also went to the [[Moulin Rouge]] and that combined with Maxim's was a nice, complimentary double bill.
