## Places

### Restaurants & Pubs

![[Casa-Patata.jpg|300]]

**[Casa Patata](https://maps.app.goo.gl/TjTGhgET128ECeFC7?g_st=ic)**: Crazy busy and nothing outstanding. But they do chips with toppings and you can eat them outside by the water as a nice snack.

![[Restaurant-Diligence.jpg|300]]

**[Restaurant Diligence](https://maps.app.goo.gl/Sz9oBfkNkXKAY2nQ8?g_st=ic)**: We didn’t eat here. But had a few drinks at the bar. It’s featured in “In Bruges”. It’s where he meets the little person and they have drinks and then do cocaine. It’s a nice intimate place with friendly bartenders.

![[Bistro-Zwart-Huis.jpg|300]]

**[Bistro Zwart Huis](https://maps.app.goo.gl/oKhvcTwjrQDgRBrG6?g_st=ic)**: Nice wood beamed pub and restaurant with music at night sometimes. Features in “In Bruges”. It’s where they have the “gay beer”. Prebook.

### Museums & Attractions

![[Groeningemuseum.jpg|300]]

**[Groeningemuseum](https://maps.app.goo.gl/zjszEAGCqwmFZ8xCA?g_st=ic)**: Nice museum. Not too big. The museum they visit in “In Bruges”. Paid entry, but worth it.

![[Basilica-of-the-Holy-Blood.jpg|300]]

**[Basilica of the Holy Blood](https://maps.app.goo.gl/YhVhpRZhZcyLqoW37?g_st=ic)**: Very old church to the right of a big cathedral/museum (I think). The Jesus blood bit is up stairs and costs. But the church on ground level is free.

![[Boniface-Bridge.jpg|300]]

**[Boniface Bridge](https://maps.app.goo.gl/fNDk5h95qRBo8qGV7?g_st=ic)**: Busy famous bridge. Great spot though. There's a [nice courtyard](https://www.google.com/maps/place/51%C2%B012'18.4%22N+3%C2%B013'28.9%22E/@51.2051053,3.222127,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m4!3m3!8m2!3d51.2051053!4d3.2247019?entry=ttu) around the corner too.

**[Viewpoint Passage Bourgondisch Cruyce](https://maps.app.goo.gl/5HfhiiC8rEJVByZm7?g_st=ic)**: Nice little viewpoint of canal. The Relais Bourgondisch Cruyce hotel is on your right which is the “B&B” they stayed in in [[In Bruges (2008)]].
