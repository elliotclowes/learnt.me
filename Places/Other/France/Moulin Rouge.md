I didn’t really know what to expect of it and I didn’t fully understand what it was. Just that it was some sort of cabaret.

But I really enjoyed the experience. The queue to get in was slow (I don’t think tables are reserved, so it’s best to get there early) and where you stood was nondescript. But once inside, wow. It was so crowded with people and tables. Which usually I’d hate. But it added to the charm, with waiters constantly flying about the place:

I wasn’t expecting the complimentary bottle of champagne, but was happy to receive it. I recommend a few drinks.

The show itself was solid. Though I have nothing to compare it too. To put it crudely it was a circus with breasts. I wasn’t expecting neither the animals or the breasts. I knew it saucy, but never really twigged that all the women dancers were bare breasted. Quite strange.

**Note**: I was quite drunk and lucked out with our table placement. If I was sober and on a worse table I think I wouldn’t have had as much fun.
