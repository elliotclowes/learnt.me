**Note**: a lot of these are personal to me. Pick and choose them as you see fit.

## Flight

Just pay for the extra leg room on the plane.

Eat light. You don't want to be hungry of course. But you also don't want your gut to be dealing with a 1/4 pound of beef.

Buy two water bottles for the flight. Yes, they're expensive. But I always get a dry throat. And a toilet break is a good excuse to get up and walk around.

Take a codeine before the flight. You don't need a prescription and it will just remove some of the discomfort of being sat down for goodness knows how long.

## Hotel

A centrally located hotel is worth the extra cost. ^573ef1

A pool is important. Even on a city break. Unless it’s going to be cold, get a place with a pool. I will visit once or twice and it’s nice in the morning.

## Entertainment

Load up more reading and movies that you think you'll need. You don’t want to run out.

Bring a book. Even on a city break. They’ll be some time to read it here and there. Often between lunch and dinner.

Bring ‘travel’ content or consume it before. [[Anthony Bourdain]], [[James Bond]], Air Mail, [[Monocle Magazine]]. All these things put me in the mood. I love it. For my [[Seville, Spain|Seville]] trip I didn’t think I needed the Monocle. But I would have preferred to have had it.

Check what events are happening before you travel. Firstly because you might accidentally book a very busy time. But secondly there might be a great one-off event happening. When I went to [[Seville, Spain|Seville]] I didn't realise until I got there that [[AC-DC]] were playing. It would have been nice to have gone.

## Food

Pre-book a bunch of restaurants. It's horrible trudging around a place trying to find a place you like the look of. Research some good ones and book them. You can always cancel them later.

Being constipated or having diarrhoea is horrible whilst traveling. I recommend having a [Fibre One bar](https://www.fibreone.co.uk/our-products/) every day to help with this. Also some [Loperamide](https://www.nhs.uk/medicines/loperamide/about-loperamide/) (Imodium) and [Dioralyte sachets](https://dioralyte.co.uk/dioralyte-family/) for if you get bad diarrhoea. The Dioralyte can also help if you get a hangover or need to quickly hydrate after not drinking enough water one day.

## Money

Don’t skimp. Better to be more frugal at home so you can go a bit more wild whilst on holiday.

Don’t bring much cash unless it’s a big cash country like Japan. In [[Seville]] people seemed borderline annoyed that I was using cash. Everywhere accepts card. And it’s so much easier.

## Other

Unless you’re going to a place with nothing but sun, you should bring a waterproof. It’s crippling being in a place with no rain protection.

Bring something warm like a jumper. Not only for when you land back in the UK, but also because you never know if they’ll be a cold snap on holiday. Or some countries crank up the air conditioning.

Fly and travel with a [chronograph](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronograph). I like timing things.

A bottle of [[aftershave]] can be heavy and I'm always scared it will leak into my suitcase. But just bring one. But spraying some aftershave on yourself once you're all dressed up and ready to go for dinner feels *good*.
