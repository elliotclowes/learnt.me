I've been doing quite a lot of design work on [[Learnt.me]] since I got back from [[Seville, Spain|Seville]]. (as well as trying to get all of my book highlights from Readwise into here. Though that's made easy via an official Obsidian plugin). The main thing that's changed design wise is that I'm no longer using an [[Edward Tufte]] inspired design (and it's associated font). I did try various custom fonts, but for whatever reason Obsidian CSS doesn't like them too much, so at the moment it's just Helvetica. But to be honest I quite like it. *Learnt.me* can be a little bit all over the place â€“ especially once you start going several pages deep. So a type like Helvetica works and makes everything more readable and palatable, I think. The other thing that's changed is that I've started using the 'sliding' stacked notes like [[Andy Matuschak]]'s '[working notes](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/About_these_notes)' (see screenshot below). Whereas before only one page could be open. But I like the stacks. It helps you remember where you've come from and lets you see your journey through the notes.
