I had eaten a large [[Nando's]] before the trip to the cinema, so I struggled to stay away for some of this. But this was good. There was too much fighting and blowjob jokes for me. But it is incessantly funny. Not all jokes land, but more than enough. I didn't understand the villains motives or plans half the time, but that's fine.

If you're a fan of Deadpool and want to see Wolverine cut loose then you'll love this. If you're not then you'll likely strong dislike it.
