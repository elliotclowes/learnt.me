## My productivity advice

- Unless it's vital for your job, only process emails and Slack messages at specific points during the day. I do it in the post-lunch energy crash around 14:00.
- Learn keyboard shortcuts. And use tools like [TextExpander](https://textexpander.com/) or [Typinator](https://ergonis.com/typinator) to
-

	- Don't keep any to-dos just in your head. Ever.
	- It's always best if to-dos can avoid your to-do list altogether. Sometimes adding things to a to-do list is a way of putting things off.
	- Keep your to-do list simple. Avoid using too many projects or tags or filters. Don’t give to-dos the opportunity to ‘hide’.
	- Look after your brain. Avoid refined sugar. Eat as much oily fish as you can. Get good sleep.
	- Take advantage of the good hours or days. When you finally do get into the focus flow don’t leave it unless you really have to. Don’t pick up your phone for a quick browse. Don’t quickly check when that film you want to watch is coming out. Stay in the flow.
	- Remove notifications
		- Only DM's on on Slack.
		- Hide the Gmail favicon that shows unread count.
	- At the end of the day look at the work and to-dos you've done that day. It's easy to forget.
	- Set a timer for 15 or 30 or 60 minutes and see how much you can get done.
