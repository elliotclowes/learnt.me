## Notes

23,000 New Zealanders worked on LOTR. 

---

Tolkien saw LOTR as one book. And the  reason it was split into three was due to the soaring paper costs following WW2. P6

---

Jackson wanted to make a fantasy film. So he spitballed ideas with Fran Walsh. With each suggested character or plot she would say “Lord of the Rings”. This happened over and over again. Until they realised that maybe they should just adapt Lord of the Rings. P45

---

Six weeks before the end of a film the freelance visual effects artists are allowed to start looking for their next job. P47

---

Whilst waiting for the rights for Lord of the Rings to be sorted (if ever) Jackson and Walsh looked for a film to do in between.

They wrote a script for a Planet of the Apes reboot. James Cameron was slated to produce and Arnold Schwarzenegger to star. P49-50
