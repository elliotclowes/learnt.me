Abandoned on page 29. 

It’s readable and skips along nicely, but it has no life to it. It just trundles along dispassionately describing events and people with very little flourish.

## Highlights
***

> London [in the 1660s] was one of a handful of 'world cities' scattered across the western hemisphere. Well-to-do Londoners drank tea from China and coffee from Arabia out of Chinese porcelain cups, enjoyed sack from Spain and the Canary Islands, put West Indian sugar in their drinks and syllabubs, smoked tobacco from Virginia, wore silks from Turkey and India, and flavoured their food with spices from Zanzibar and Indonesia. In the winter the wealthy kept their heads warm with hats made from beaver pelts from the far north of America. All this luxury was imported on English ships made watertight with tar and pitch from the Baltic, with sails hoisted aloft by ropes made with hemp from Russia to billow out from masts and spars made from Swedish pine. When Charles II returned from exile, he was instantly involved in the commercial life of the city, particularly investing in and encouraging the slave trade, an issue examined here in some depth.

> We should define here what constituted a merchant in seventeenth-century London. A merchant was a wholesaler who almost certainly traded goods on the international market. Those who sold goods or services on the domestic market were never known as merchants; they were simply known after their trades, as haberdashers, shipwrights, vintners, tailors, and so on. A merchant had a status well above the average person in a trade. Some merchants, it was said, were as rich as princes. (Page 14)
