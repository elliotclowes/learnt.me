Effective business analyst helps: 
- Address business needs
- Manage risk and reduce rewoek
- Minimise product, defects, recalls, lawsuits, and reduction in consumer confidence
- Achieve stakeholder satisfaction

Organisations are often tempted to provide solutions before fully understanding a situation. Business analysis helps them identify and fix the root cause, rather than the symptom.

***

The “sufficient” amount of business analysis is dependent on a businesses risk appetite and the level of confidence required before an initiative can proceed.

While business analysis can require time and resources, if it is overlooked, it can result in insufficiently understood requirements, missed stakeholder expectations and other frustrations or issues. These can lead to rework and request for change. So taking the time to conduct business analysis actually should save time, reduce cost, and minimise risk exposure in the long run.

The role of a BA is often misunderstood or underutilised or confused with others roles, like a project manager. A PM and BA should have a high level of collaboration, but not a high level of role overlap.

One of the issues BA’s face is that their role isn’t often well understood. When mixed with the with the fact that they are often versatile workers, they are commonly given tasks that shouldn’t be done by them. So role boundaries are important to establish.
