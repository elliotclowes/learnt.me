## Review

Really enjoyed this one. It does exactly what it says on the tin. It contains stories and biographies of four of the biggest "hellraiser" actors: [[Richard Burton]], [[Richard Harris]], [[Peter O'Toole]], and [[Oliver Reed]].

It's simple, enjoyable. A good holiday read. Though I do certainly have a love/hate relationship with the hellraisers. They're essentially just alcoholics. And behind a lot of the "fun" stories is a mistreated wife or an innocent person who quite rightly asked a loud drunk to keep the noise down and got a punch as a result. And whilst I enjoy stories about drunkards getting up to mischief I'm always fully aware that if *I* saw these deeds and people in the flesh I'd find them insufferable.

## Highlights

I highlighted on my Kindle and haven't gotten around to exporting them. I must do that.
