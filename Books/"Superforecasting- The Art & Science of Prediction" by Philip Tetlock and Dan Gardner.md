## Notes

Using percentages when making forecasts is important. It forces the forecaster to think harder and come up with an actual number. Language is easier. “Slight chance”, instead of “30% chance”. Also words are more malleable after the forecasted event:

> If the event happens, “a fair chance” can retroactively be stretched to mean something considerably bigger than 50% – so the forecaster nailed it. If it doesn’t happen, it can be shrunk to something much smaller than 50% – and again, the forecast nailed it. With perverse incentives like these, it’s no wonder people prefer rubbery words over firm numbers. P58

Weather forecasting is lends itself to quickly working out if the forecaster is accurate. There’s new weather everyday. Most forecasts are rarer. Take the U.S. Presidential Elections. They’ve been going on for over 200 years, but there’s been less than 60 of them. If you’re forecasting them, that’s not a lot of data. And that’s a lot of gaps between new data. P61-62
