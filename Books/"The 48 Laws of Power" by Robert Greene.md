## To Look Into

### [[Otto von Bismarck]]
There’s this line in the book:
> bBismarck was certainly one of the cleverest statesman who ever lived, a master of strategy and deception. P20

He is certainly one of my [[Blind Spots]]. And this line has intrigued me. I need to check him out.

## Notes

### Preface
- The idea of aiming for power in current times strikes most people as plain wrong. But under the surface people are still vying for people. They are usually more subtle and covert about it.
- You can ignore the game of power, but at your peril. If you don’t have the tools to deal with people and their desire for power you will suffer.
- Power’s crucial foundation is the ability to master your emotions. Emotions cloud your vision. And anger is the worst of all emotions.
- Take the motto “No days unalert” to heart. You have to imagine every possible future outcome and be prepared for all the permutations. My note: Great chess players are often great because they can see further into the future and have considered possible moves. You have to do the same in life.
- Power is a social game. So it’s vital you understand people. Especially their motivations and see through their supposed motivations.

### Law 1: Never Outshine the Master
- Always make your superiors feel superior. Impress them, but do not go too far. Don’t tread on their toes. P1
- **[[Nicolas Fouquet]] and [[Louis XIV]]**
	- Nicolas Fouquet, Louis XIV's finance minister, celebrated the completion of his château, Faux-le-Vicomte, with an extravagant party meant to honor the king. The party showcased lavish dinners, musical performances, and fireworks. While Fouquet hoped this spectacle would reinforce his loyalty and importance to the king, it had the opposite effect. The grandeur of the event made Louis XIV feel overshadowed, leading to Fouquet's arrest the next day on charges of stealing from the treasury. Fouquet was imprisoned for two decades. Fouquet's attempt to impress backfired, illustrating the peril of overshadowing those in power. ^453e02
	- Lessons you might learn:
		- What you might intend as a tribute might be interpreted as a challenge.
		- People in power are ironically often insecure in that power. You’ll likely get a negative response to any perceived challenge to their power.
		- Sometimes you need to be discreet about your successes when dealing with your superior. Both your accomplishments and your wealth. Remember: superiors like feeling superior. Don’t wear a nicer suit and a more expensive watch than your boss. Your boss wears a £30 Casio? Then leave your £600 Tissot at home. Your boss wears a £600 Tissot? Then leave your £4000 Omega at home.
		- Don’t forget that no matter how important or indispensable you might be, you can still be discarded. Even if you know and your superior know that they will be worse off without you that still doesn’t give you unlimited security. They’ll do anything to protect their power.
		- History is littered with ‘favourites’ who are very quickly removed. Even if you’re the ‘golden child’ of your superior remember that you can be removed at a moments notice.
- The rule is to never outshine your superior. But there *is* a time when you need outshine them. And that is when their position is insecure and when they’re on a ‘down’. That’s when you pounce and show all your skill and talent.

### Law 2: Never Put Too Much Trust in Friends, Learn How to Use Enemies
- Friends can be less reliable than you might think. Their true intentions and feelings are often hidden. Whereas your enemies often reveal with feelings and intentions.
- One of the best ways to defeat an enemy is not to defeat them at all, but to make friends of them.
- Enemies are often an untapped resource.
- An enemy is great motivator.
- Friends can be useful scapegoats. And people generally think you won’t blame a close personal friend for nothing. P15
- Otto von Bismarck disliked Austria and wanted to go with war with them – and everyone knew it. But he was just a deputy in Parliament with no real power. Knowing that the tide was against him and that the Prussian army wasn’t at a point to beat the Austrian’s he made a very public volte-face. A few weeks later the King, grateful that he argued for peace, made him a cabinet minister. A few years later he because the Prussian premier. He now had the power to go to war, and he did. You have to know when to reveal your true opinion and when to hide it. Timing is important. And if it gives you more power as a result, that’s all the better. P19-20
- Honesty is actually a blunt instrument. He bloodies more than it cuts. It’s much more prudent to tailor your words.

### Law 3: Conceal Your Intentions

Those most mistrustful of you can still be deceived. All you have to do is make them worry and focus about one main thing. Make a big show of it and let them focus on it. Their gaze will be so focused on that that you can then focus on defeating them elsewhere. P27

### Law 6: Court Attention At All Cost

An air of mystery heightens your presence. 

By being slightly mysterious people remember you.

People not knowing what you’re all about is a form of power.

Don’t be a loon, but a bit of eccentricity can make you more memorable and mysterious.

Don’t reveal all your cards. Most people are up front. By holding back slightly you stand out and people will be intrigued by you.

Your air of mystery must seem like a game, playful and unthreatening. It shouldn’t appear like you’re trying to hide something or be deceitful. P55

There are times when you shouldn’t aim to be the centre of attention. Like when someone much higher than you is present. P55

### Law 7: Get Others to Do the Work for You, but Always Take the Credit

People have a tendency to think that their industry or work place is immune to backstabbing and politics. This is a mistake. It is everywhere. P58

***

Make sure you get credit for your work. People around you may steal your credit or work. Be wary of this. If you can keep work and its details private until the right moment. P58

***

Some are the hunters. And some are the hunted. If you’re not one, then you’re the other. P59

***

Peter Paul Rubens would hire other painters who specialised in certain things to help him produce his paintings faster and better. He would hire someone to specialise in robes, another in background landscapes, etc. This was hidden from the clients.

You need to be like this. Not only will you produce more work, but it will be better work. 

You need to work out what your weakest points are and get someone else to cover that part of you.

*** 

### Law 9: Win Through Your Actions, Never Through Argument

An argument put forth is rarely perceived as neutral. People take it personally. Even if they come round to your side there’s a chance of resentment. You need to *show* them your point, not *argue* it. Not only are you more likely to ‘win’ that way, but the person is less likely to be hurt by their change of sides. They feel like they had more control of the decision.

***

### Law 10: Infection: Avoid the Unhappy and Unlucky

Misfortune and fortune can be infectious. Avoid the former. At first you might pity them or feel sorry for them, but don’t fall for the trap. They will infect you. People have bad parts and bad periods, but if there’s a person whose entire life seems a mess then avoid them at all costs. They are infected. So just walk away. 

They often play the victim and always claim their problems are due to other people and outside forces, but that’s usually not the case – and even if it’s not, they can still infect you.

***

You can use infection to your advantage. Avoid people with the same ’bad’ traits as yourself. Instead find people who are the opposite. If you’re shy, associate with the gregarious. If you’re miserly, find generous friends. If you’re naturally miserable, then find acquaintances who are always happy. P81
