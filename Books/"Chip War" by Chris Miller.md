## Review

I didn't finish this. It wasn't a bad book. I just wasn't in the mood for it I think. And currently it's propping up my computer monitor. So I won't be picking it up and giving it another go again for a while.

## Highlights
***

> Today, Apple's most advanced processors— which are arguably the world's most advanced semiconductors-can only be produced by a single company in a single building, the most expensive factory in human history… (Page 1)

***

> Last year, the chip industry produced more transistors than the combined quantity of all goods produced by all other companies, in all other industries, in all human history. Nothing else comes close.
>
> It was only sixty years ago that the number of transistors on a cuttingedge chip wasn't 11.8 billion, but 4. In 1961, south of San Francisco, a small firm called Fairchild Semiconductor announced a new product called the Micrologic, a silicon chip with four transistors embedded in it (Page 1)

> Kilby called his invention an "integrated circuit," but it became known colloquially as a "chip," because each integrated circuit was made from a piece of silicon "chipped" off a circular silicon wafer. (Page 15)
