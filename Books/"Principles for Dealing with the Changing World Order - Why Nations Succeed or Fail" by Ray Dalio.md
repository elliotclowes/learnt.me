Your country having one of the worlds reserve currencies is a wonderful thing. It gives you buying power and geo-political power. But there are pros and cons. The big con being that you can borrow more than you can afford to pay back. As other countries want your currency. So you can borrow and borrow. 

More benefits and drawbacks:

Benefits:
1. Exceptional borrowing and spending power
2. Significant control over the global distribution of money and credit
3. Enormous buying power and geopolitical influence

Drawbacks:
1. Over-borrowing due to the ability to create more money and credit
2. Debasement of the currency's value
3. Eventual loss of reserve currency status

Dalio points out that countries without a reserve currency often face difficulties when they have substantial debts denominated in a reserve currency, as they cannot print that currency and may struggle to earn it. This can lead to bankruptcy for these countries, as well as local governments and individuals.

The extract highlights the double-edged nature of having a reserve currency, as it provides immense power and influence but also sows the seeds of its own demise through over-borrowing and currency debasement.

Central banks control money and credit and they use them as tools to try and control the economy and keep it steady. When there’s too much growth and inflation is rising they will limit the supply of money and increase the cost of credit. When the economy is too slow they will create money and lower interest rates to make credit cheaper. These are smaller 5-10 year cycles within the larger 50-75 year long-term debt cycle. P144

“Fiat money” is money that is not tied to gold, silver, copper, etc, unlike “hard money”. Countries often move to fiat when there just isn’t enough assets to back the hard money for the amount of debt they want to create. They could continue just not have enough assets to cover their debt, but if investors caught wind of that fact they might all try and cash in their credit at once, causing a run on the bank. P120
