## To Look Into

### Ossian

‘Osian’ was the author of a collection of ancient Gaelic poems. They were very popular and very keenly embraced by those of Scottish extraction and was compared alongside the greats of world literature like the works of Homer and Virgil. They were the work of James Macpherson Who claimed he had found manuscripts.

However, as time went on, there was more and more doubt about the authenticity of the work. Samuel Johnson was one of the few who doubted its authenticity, and asked to see proof, such as the manuscripts. This was never provided. it’s now largely believed that MacPherson wrote it all himself, though was inspired by ancient Gaelic works. p51-56

## New Words

**Laird.**
> the owner of a large, long-established [Scottish](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scotland "Scotland") estate.

## Notes

Boswell didn’t meeting Johnson until Johnson was 53.

***

Boswell went to University with Henry Dundas. P5

***

“Boswell was a sensitive child: physically, delicate, timid, terrified of ghosts, frightened of the dark, and tormented by morbid ideas of external punishment.” He suffered with depression all his life, starting from a young age. He had some sort of breakdown aged 16 and was sent to the village of Moffat to recuperate. He was also there before aged 12 for a “nervous complaint”.

Mental illness ran in the family. Potentially made worse by his father marrying his cousin.

But when he wasn’t suffering from depression he was usually high-spirited and boisterous. He wasn’t gloomy by nature.

Boswell took some pride in his depression. Being prone to ‘melancholy’ was some somewhat fashionable to a certain sort of crowd as it was considered an affliction suffered by those of superior intellects. P5-7

***

Boswell was outgoing and fun. He liked women and women liked him. He fell in and out of love easily. 

He was also prone to acting the fool. He said he’s sacrifice anything for a laugh, ‘even myself’.

He was also fond of acting and was known for being an entertaining mimic and impersonator.

NOTE
The book says that the theatre in Scotland during Boswell’s time was illegal (but tolerated). I didn’t know this and was curious.
GPT-4 explains: 

During James Boswell's time, the theater in Scotland was indeed controversial and faced legal challenges. The primary reason for this was religious.

In the late 17th and early 18th centuries, the Scottish Reformation led to the establishment of a very strict form of Presbyterianism in Scotland, particularly within the Church of Scotland (often referred to as the Kirk). The leadership of the Kirk held Puritanical views, seeing the theater as immoral, frivolous, and a potential source of vice. They believed that plays encouraged idleness, vanity, and could lead the faithful away from the teachings of the Bible. As a result, public theatrical performances were banned in Scotland for much of the 18th century.

While the formal ban made theater illegal, as you mentioned, it was often tolerated, especially in Edinburgh. The public's interest in plays and the arts persisted despite the ban, leading to underground or "guerilla" performances. Over time, the public and even some members of the elite became more receptive to theater, leading to a gradual relaxation of the ban. By the time James Boswell was active in the latter half of the 18th century, theater was becoming more accepted, even if it remained technically illegal.

This backdrop made Boswell's theater-going both an act of personal enjoyment and a minor form of rebellion against the more conservative elements of Scottish society.

***

Boswell’s father sent him to the University of Glasgow after the University of Edinburgh, in order to give him fewer distractions. It was here that his professor of moral philosophy was Adam Smith. P10.

***

Boswell was struck by Adam Smith’s advocacy for a pure English style. During this period the Scots had lots different pronunciations to the English and also Scotticisms – different words entirely. P10

Boswell was conscious of his accent, knowing that the London high society that he wanted to be a part of  would look down on anyone too Scottish. He attended lectures by Thomas Sheridan on ‘correct’ English usage. P13

***

Boswell always fancied himself as a poet (though most consider him a very poor one). This started at a young age. And he would write poems and pamphlets under various pseudonyms. One of which was “A Genius”. Ha. P14

***

Boswell always struggled with money. He liked life’s luxuries. He came from a wealthy Scottish family but you get the sense that in London that wasn’t enough. So he spent beyond his means. P14-15

***

Boswell was quite the celebrity hunter. He was also keen to meet the most famous person in town on his travels. And if they turned him away he could be very persistent.

***

After his trip to Corsica – where he was one of the first Brits to visit – he offered his expertise on the country to William Pitt the Elder. Pitt had been out of office, but Boswell would never miss an opportunity to get acquainted with another face. Pitt recommended he offer his advice to the current Secretary of State instead. Boswell persisted. And he arrived for the meeting as “native Corsican chief, with stiletto and Paoli’s pistols in his belt, and wearing a cap complete with a tuft of cock’s feathers.” Ha! P40

***

Boswell’s first literary success was his "Account of Corsica" (1768). P41.

***

Boswell married his cousin, Margaret Montgomerie. He was a loving father and an affectionate husband, but not loyal. After a few years of marriage he began visiting prostitutes. Be would often confess this to her.

He insisted that he call him “Mr Boswell”, rather than “Jamie”. P45

***

Boswell went to the Lord Mayor’s ball and banquet. It was a posh event, full of the highest members of society. But rather amusingly when the doors opened for the dining room for dinner there was a mad scrabble by everyone to get the best seats. I love that image. These 1700s characters, dressed the nines, all rushing and pushing to get the best seats. The human core never changes. P48.

***

“Pay the visit and the the ramble.” – Samuel Johnson. P49

***

When Samuel Johnson spent a few days at the Boswell family home in Edinburgh, before beginning their Hebrides adventure, he annoyed Boswell’s wife Margaret by his habits of endlessly drinking tea, and spilling candlewax as he read late into the night. P49

***

When on their Hebrides adventure Boswell began to express his regret that Scotland had lost her independence in the Treaty of the Union. And the keeper of the records said that the Scottish Parliament had been bribed with English money to sign the treaty. “Sir, that is no defence”, said Johnson: “that makes you worse”. P51

***

P56-60 is a good section on Boswells and Johnson’s tour of the Hebrides, where they spent time in the Highlands. At first, they were entertained by a Scottish landowner, who they didn’t like, and who they felt didn’t represent their romanticised image of a clan leader from the Highlands. But then they met a clansman who did. It’s worth a re-read.

***

Before starting “The Club”, Samuel Johnson was in [The Ivy Lane](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ivy_Lane_Club) club, a literary discussion group. P78.

***

After Samuel Johnson‘s death, there was a literary scramble to write biographies of him. His friend said John Hawkins appointed himself as Johnson’s official biographer. He was also Johnson’s executor after death, so had the advantage of access to his private papers and his diary in particular. Hester Thrale was anlso rumoured to be working on a biography. She was a longtime friend and she occupied a special place in Johnson’s heart, and might know secrets in accessible to others. As he was more open with her than others.

Boswell was pressured by his publisher and those around him to get working on and finishing a biography of Johnson as soon as possible. In order to cash in. There was unsurity how long public interest in Johnson would continue after his death. But despite all this Boswell would not be rushed. In fact, he wanted to see what others wrote about Johnson, first, in order to “receive additional information and correct mistakes and misrepresentations”. P78-79


***
Diseased people would gather around and close by to a public execution, as they believed that being touched by the sweaty hands of the dying could cure them. P96-97

***

Boswell had a weird fascination with death. He would visit people condemned to die on the day of their execution. He also liked to look at the bodies and their faces afterwards. P97

***

The laid back, gossipy, personal and *“The Journal to the Hebrides with Samuel Johnson”* was quite revolutionary and shocking when published. It was so personal that people didn’t know how to take it. Biographies were nearly always positive and focused on big moments, events and didn’t publish private conversations and letters. Edmond Malone helped Boswell tone it down and make it a bit more formal, but it was still a very personal book and many took slight offence.

***

Boswell arguably lacked some tact in which opinions on other people by Johnson he included in his *“The Journal to the Hebrides with Samuel Johnson”*. As a modern reader we’re glad they’re in there. But he upset a lot of people and lost a lot of friends as a result and people become weary of him. He also upset plenty of powerful acquaintances, who may have helped his career. The book was a great success. But was a disaster when it came to his career prospects.

***

It wasn’t until about 18 months after Johnson’s that Boswell started writing “Life”. He first was working on the “Hebrides” and then spent time gathering materials from people far and wide. But he was aware that public interest might wain if he took too long. Plenty of people wrote him letters saying so to.

"A decent provision for the poor is the true test of civilisation." – Samuel Johnson

***

In a time when it was considered okay for writers to say things like “if I remember right” and “I think I might have read” Boswell was in contrast keen to find out the source of things he was putting into “Life”. He would gladly go from one side of London to the other just to confirm a date. For the time Boswell was incredibly committed to ensuring as much as possible was accurate. P232-233

> Boswell's persistence, his desire to verify what seemed to others the most trifling detail, his zeal for 'scrupulous authenticity', seemed absurd to many of his contemporaries. The Scottish judge Lord Hailes, who had known Boswell all his life, warned him to omit  insignificant details - and to remember that Dr Johnson was the principal subject of the book. Boswell was sensitive to such criticism. 'Were I to detail the books which I have consulted, and the inquiries which I have found it necessary to make by various channels, I should probably be thought ridiculously ostentatious," he wrote defensively in the 'Advertisement' to the first edition of the Life. 'Let me only observe, as a specimen of my trouble, that I have sometimes been obliged to run half over London, in order to fix a date correctly; which, when I had accomplished, I well knew would obtain me no praise, though a failure would have been to my discredit. This was a period when most authors, including Johnson himself, were content to rely on previous authorities, or just on memory as a source. Boswell deplored the habit of introducing anecdotes, facts, and even quotations with phrases such as 'I think I have read' or 'If I remember right', when the originals were available to be examined. He was determined to paint a 'Flemish picture' of his friend, faithful to life and accurate in every detail. The nature of such a work consisted of 'innumerable detached particulars', and to ascertain their authenticity Boswell was prepared to go to a degree of trouble beyond that of any other species of composition'. There were moments when he felt that the task might be beyond him. 'You cannot imagine,' he exclaimed to his friend Temple, 'what labour, what perplexity, what vexation, I have endured in arranging a prodigious multiplicity of materials, in supplying omissions, in searching for papers, buried in different and all this besides the exertion of composing and polishing. Many a time have I thought of giving it up.

***

The "Life of Samuel Johnson" was published on 16 May 1791. P275

***

Johnson was good at writing ‘dedications’ for King’s, queens, etc. at the start of books. So much so that he often wrote the dedications for other authors books for them. P285
