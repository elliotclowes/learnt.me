- 07:46: Awake at 06:15. 10-15 minutes of TikTok. 10 minutes of newsletter reading. Then out for a 30 minute walk around the block. Went to One Stop for milk for mum and Evian and some chocolate for Abigail. Well, One Stop didn’t have Evian, so I went to Co-op for that. Now I’ve just brewed a coffee and am about to do some more newsletter reading on my iPad before waking up Abigail at 08:00.
