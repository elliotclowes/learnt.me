I picked up a virus or the flu from [[Dad]] recently. The symptoms weren't too bad. Mostly just a sore throat. But the problem with having [[Long Covid]] or [[M.E.]] or whatever it is I have is that any sort of virus can cause bigger more longer term issues.

And that's what I'm worried about with this latest virus. Ever since I've picked it up my muscles have been constantly sore. Not even my muscles actually. It feels more like my *skeleton*. Mostly in my upper legs. My brain hasn't been working as well either. I'm struggling to get back in the swing of things with work. My energy and brain capacity seems low.

It's partly my own fault. I didn't eat well through the virus, which never helps.

Either way, I hope I'm back to 100% soon and that I have no long term effects.
