[[2024-07-08 1]]: **Field Notes notebooks**. I've been getting into notebooks recently. I've used Field Notes in the past and really liked them. But they're pricey and I have a Moleskine notebook already. The reason I was tempted by the Field Notes is because of its thinness. The Moleskine doesn't fit comfortably in the pocket.
