- 04:05: Woke up early so I can be tired enough to get to bed nice and early tonight ahead of the flight to [[Seville]] tomorrow. I'll have to be up around 03:45.
- 08:06: Spent the morning mostly sorting out [[blot.blog]] posts. Removing tags that are unlikely to be used twice as well as fixing broken images from when I move from [[WordPress]] to [[Hugo]].
