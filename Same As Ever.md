One of the reasons why 1950’s American’s were happier is not because they were better off. Adjusted for inflation, American’s of today are better of by most measurable things. It’s because of lack of expectations and comparisons with others being less painful.

Between 1942 and 1945 wages were set by the National War Labor Board. Wages were fairly flat across the board, with new a great deal of difference between those at the top and those at the bottom. That continued after the war for a decade or so.
