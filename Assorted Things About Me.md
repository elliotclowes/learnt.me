When it comes to partners I wouldn’t say I have a physical type really. I think I’m a bit more woman-like in that personality is the key thing. I find people attractive because of their personality, not how they look. 

Humour is a big one. If they’re funny, I’m some. As is weirdness. I can walk on the weird side too, so I find it insanely attractive in others. And the ability to ‘spitball’ is key. If they seem like they would be up for talking with me about anything and everything, I like that.

Aside from that, ideally we have an overlapping interest in walking, films and books.

They also need to not hate my eccentricities and issues caused by my [[ADHD]].
