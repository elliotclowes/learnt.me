What professional writers know about typography can usually be traced back to unreliable sources—typing-class and computer-lab teachers, parents, freshman roommates, blog commenters. I’m sure they all meant well. But they didn’t know much about typography.

It’s not surprising that bad typography habits get passed along. What’s surprising is how tenacious they can be.

A core principle of this book is that professional writers should hold their documents to the same standards as any professionally published material, like books, newspapers, and magazines. There are not differing categories of typography—say, academic typography vs. legal typography vs. business typography. There is only typography.

This wasn’t always true. For a long time—the typewriter era and then the early computer era—professional publishers could afford typesetting and printing devices that were financially impractical for individuals. So for most writers, the typographic standards of professional publishers were far out of reach.

But that’s no longer the case. On the printed page, the typesetting technology available to individuals is very close to what’s available to professional publishers. On the screen, there’s no difference at all. Technological excuses are no longer acceptable.

Therefore, professional writers should aspire to meet the standards of professional typography. That’s why the rules here reflect the customs of professional typographers and the majority views of authorities on typography.

Must writers adopt every habit of professional typographers? No. I use professional typography as a benchmark for quality, not as an all-or-nothing goal. When faced with a choice between more consistency with professional typography or less, writers should choose more.

But I’m also practical—hence the title of the book. I don’t assume that writers have the time or interest to become professional typographers. I assume that your goal is to get the best typographic results for the lowest cost, and that nothing is more costly than your time. Therefore, I recommend a few shortcuts where the effort outweighs the results.

Hello there! My name is [Elliot Clowes](https://elliotclowes.com) and welcome to my little corner of the web.

## What is this?

This site is made up of my notes (currently 439 of them). There's notes for all sorts. Things I’ve learnt, [[-Book Notes|book highlights that inspire me]], [[Favourite Articles|great articles I’ve read]], ‘life logs’, and my personal preferences and opinions on everything from furniture to living life. *Learnt.me* is essentially my brain in digital form. None of the notes are ever finished. They're constantly being updated as I learn new things and have new thoughts.

There's more in-depth info about the site [[About This Site|here]].

I recommend you just poke around and see what you find. Some notes are very short, others very long.

Why not start with my favourite [[Favourite Articles|articles]], [[Favourite Books|books]], [[Favourite Music|music]], [[Favourite Paintings|paintings]] and [[Favourite Podcasts|podcasts]].

Or here's some random notes to get you started that all come from [["English Food - A People’s History" by Diane Purkiss|the same book]]:

## What am I up to right now?

Updated: **June 1st, 2024**

- I'm about 7 or so months in at [News UK](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/News_UK), working as a Business Analyst (BA). My workload is a bit high so my development as a BA is kind of being put on the back burner. But in a few months I'll go from being on three teams to two and that should make things easier.
- I continue to fail to improve my health. These bad habits are really *sticky*. I just got back from my trip to [[Seville, Spain|Seville]]. It gave me a bit of 'reset' diet wise and I was pleased with my food choices whilst out there. I just need to continue eating with my stomach, not my eyes now that I'm back in the UK. You can monitor my [[weight history]] if you'd like.
