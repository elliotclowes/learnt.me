Hello there! My name is Elliot Clowes and this is my little corner of the web.

I like technology, reading and walking. You can also see my favourite [[Favourite Articles|articles]], [[Favourite Books|books]], [[Favourite Music|music]], [[Favourite Paintings|paintings]] and [[Favourite Podcasts|podcasts]].

## What is this site?

*Learnt.me* is a collection of my notes turned into a website. But it’s much more than that. It’s me and my brain in digital form. On this website I add things I’ve learn, book highlights that inspire me, great articles I’ve read, a ‘life log’, and my personal preferences on everything from furniture to living life. This site will forever be a work in progress. [[About This Site|More in-depth info here]].

## What am I up to right now?

Updated: **December 5th, 2023**

- Still getting to grips with my new job at [News UK](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/News_UK) as a Business Analyst.
	- There's a lot to learn and I've hit my first 'blocks' after being there for two months now.
	- I'm really enjoying working from home two days a week. I find an office a distracting environment. So when I work from home I can get more work done. It doesn't always work like this. But I like my office days to be my meetings days and my WFH ones my deep work days.
- I'm still trying to get my health of track.
	- I've been failing though.
	- This is is probably the longest continuous time I've spent 'unhealthy'. And it's starting to show I think. I've had some stomach pain and I feel nausea sometimes. Not a good sign! I'm currently going through the healthcare system to look into it more.
