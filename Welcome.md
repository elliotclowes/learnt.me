Hello there! My name is [Elliot Clowes](https://elliotclowes.com) and welcome to my little corner of the web.

## What is this?

This site is made up of my notes. There's all manner of things here. Things I’ve learnt, book highlights that inspire me, great articles I’ve read, ‘life logs’, and my personal preferences and pinions on everything from furniture to living life. *Learnt.me* is essentially my brain in digital form. [[About This Site|More in-depth info here]].

## New here?

I recommend you just poke around and see what you find. Some notes are very short, others very long.

Why not start with my favourite [[Favourite Articles|articles]], [[Favourite Books|books]], [[Favourite Music|music]], [[Favourite Paintings|paintings]] and [[Favourite Podcasts|podcasts]].

Or here's some random notes to get you started:
- [[Assize of Bread and Ale]]
- [[Full English]]
- [[Goddisgood]]
- [["English Food - A People’s History" by Diane Purkiss]]
- [[Samuel Johnson]]
- [[Virginia Woolf]]
## What am I up to right now?

Updated: **May 23rd, 2024**

- I'm about 7 or so months in at [News UK](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/News_UK), working as a Business Analyst.
- I continue to fail to improve my health. These bad habits are *sticky*. I'm hoping my trip to [[Seville, Spain|Seville]] at the end of May will give me a bit of a 'reset' and when I get back to the UK I can start afresh.
