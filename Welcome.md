Hello there! My name is [Elliot Clowes](https://elliotclowes.com) and welcome to my little corner of the web.

## What is this?

This site is made up of my notes (currently 439 of them). There's notes for all sorts. Things I’ve learnt, [[-Book Notes|book highlights that inspire me]], [[Favourite Articles|great articles I’ve read]], ‘life logs’, and my personal preferences and opinions on everything from furniture to living life. *Learnt.me* is essentially my brain in digital form. None of the notes are ever finished. They're constantly being updated as I learn new things and have new thoughts.

There's more in-depth info about the site [[About This Site|here]].

## New here?

I recommend you just poke around and see what you find. Some notes are very short, others very long.

Why not start with my favourite [[Favourite Articles|articles]], [[Favourite Books|books]], [[Favourite Music|music]], [[Favourite Paintings|paintings]] and [[Favourite Podcasts|podcasts]].

Or here's some random notes to get you started that all come from [["English Food - A People’s History" by Diane Purkiss|the same book]]:
- [[Assize of Bread and Ale]]
- [[Full English]]
- [[Goddisgood]]
- [[Samuel Johnson]]
- [[Virginia Woolf]]

## What am I up to right now?

Updated: **June 1st, 2024**

- I'm about 7 or so months in at [News UK](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/News_UK), working as a Business Analyst (BA). My workload is a bit high so my development as a BA is kind of being put on the back burner. But in a few months I'll go from being on three teams to two and that should make things easier.
- I continue to fail to improve my health. These bad habits are really *sticky*. I just got back from my trip to [[Seville, Spain|Seville]]. It gave me a bit of 'reset' diet wise and I was pleased with my food choices whilst out there. I just need to continue eating with my stomach, not my eyes now that I'm back in the UK. You can monitor my [[weight history]] if you'd like.
