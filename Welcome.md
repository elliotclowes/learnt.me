Hello there! My name is Elliot Clowes and this is my little corner of the web.

I like technology, reading and walking. You can also see my favourite [[Favourite Articles|articles]], [[Favourite Books|books]], [[Favourite Music|music]], [[Favourite Paintings|paintings]] and [[Favourite Podcasts|podcasts]].

## What is this site?

*Learnt.me* is a collection of my notes turned into a website. It's essentially my brain in digital form. Within these pages are things I’ve learnt, book highlights that inspire me, great articles I’ve read, a ‘life log’, and my personal preferences on everything from furniture to living life. This site will forever be a work in progress. [[About This Site|More in-depth info here]].

## What am I up to right now?

Updated: **May 23rd, 2024**

- I'm about 7 or so months in at [News UK](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/News_UK), working as a Business Analyst.
- I continue to fail to improve my health. These bad habits are *sticky*. I'm hoping my trip to [[Seville, Spain|Seville]] at the end of May will give me a bit of a 'reset' and when I get back to the UK I can start afresh.
